I recall seeing somewhere that they were only putting personal pizzas on the buffet these days, but that isn't the case, at least at this location.  They are full-fledged pies.  Pizza Hut pies, to be sure, but they are the real ones, not the baby-sized ones.  That can actually be both good and bad.\\n\\nIt's good because you can get a decent slice from the buffet.  It can be bad because with room for only four pizzas at a time, and with one of those at any given time being a dessert pizza, it means if one of the three main pizzas isn't one that you like, you may have to wait for one that you like.  This is an issue because the restaurant isn't very busy - probably the reason for the banner outside.  As such, the three pizzas don't go very fast.\\n\\nStill, if you're at Pizza Hut, chances are that you like their pizza at least okay.  It's not like you're out on a limb to try something adventurous.  If you want more variety, go to CiCi's Pizza.  If you want something good, try Big Guy's Pizza instead.\\n\\nAnyway, the pizza isn't bad.  You just don't get a lot of choices.  They also have pasta, but in my experience, it's usually almost gone.  I don't know if this is because people don't like the choices of pizza and eat all the pasta, because they don't put much out, or some combination of both.  There are also bread sticks, but they don't usually have many of those either.  There is a good bit of marinara sauce, but I'm not sure what you're supposed to use it on, since the pizza has plenty and there is usually little pasta or bread.  You can also get a salad, but it costs extra.\\n\\nThe service is generally friendly, but not very good.  The price is a bit much.  For all this and a drink you'll pay more than you should.

No topping of fluids, no rotating of my tires... so I ask what oil change did you do? The mechanic says Basic. And I asked, what does the Groupon say? He says Preferred. And I said, my car requires a synthetic blend. And what happened to my tired rotation? The mechanic said oh we rotated the tires too; I watched him do it. Everything that should've been done is handled miss. I go outside, and the same chalk marking that was there on my left rear tire, is still there, on the left rear. Smh.

I used to live right down the road from the Saucer and went there several times a week in order to earn my own gold plate up on the wall (something you get after drinking 200 different beers).

I'm thrilled if I can pull a beer not slapped with a \\\"Lite\\\" label; or when I ask for a stout the waitress has something other than Guinness to provide. I crave diversity of lagers and ales like a foodie craves weirdly named cheeses. I'm pretty sure, in fact, that the Saucer was created for people exactly like me.\\n\\nWalking into the door I instantly get the same feeling of the hole-in-the-wall pubs I frequented back in college - just much larger. And cleaner! Almost every surface not walkable in the building is covered in decorative dishes so dense that your grandma's cabinet just shed a tear. It's cluttered but not oppressive, and again, it always feels clean and comfortable. There's a couched section up front for those really lazy days; elevated booths on the wall for small parties; and a lot of tables for any size group you can organize. And then there's the bar...\\n\\nBellying up to the bar at the Saucer is easy - it's roughly 50 feet long. From this bastion of beervana, you can see the real reason you came here - the jaw-dropping wall of tap heads and stuffed bottle coolers. It's a selection so big that trying to pick by looking is almost a fool's errand - you could easily down a pint just while trying to weigh the options. Thankfully, they have a well-organized (and four-page dense) beer menu that will help you find just the draft or bottle you're looking for. I want to give some kind of feeling for what you'll find here, but the simple answer is - everything. I've had everything from double IPAs aged in oak barrels to blueberry wheat beer to a savory coffee milk stout. Any style you could ever want, well, it's here. It's impressive. It's a little terrifying. It's very, very delicious. There are $3 fire sale specials every night of the week as well. Saturday's \\\"Beer Poker\\\" is my favorite - a random bottle from their cooler for three bucks. I've scored a few Victory and Rogue bottles there, so it is definitely not just the leftovers. \\n\\nAs for the food, well... It's decent. Let's be fair, I'm not coming here for their burgers. Food at the saucer is a means to an end; the food is here so you can cleanse your pallet between brews. That being said, there are a few musts on the menu. For a snack, you cannot beat the soft pretzels. You get two, they're huge, warm, salty and soft - if you're on a date and you don't get this, don't expect a second date. The brats are decent, the burgers have flavor, and oh yeah - spicy cheesy pepper tater tots. You'll find something. \\n\\nI guess the last thing worth mentioning is the service. A place with this diverse a beer selection could rest on its laurels, but the Saucer follows through with an excellent staff. Beyond the fact that your waitresses are gorgeous smiling Beer Goddesses wearing short short skirts and knee-hi stockings... They're genuinely nice and know what they've got on the menu. Talking with them is talking with peers. They check in on the table frequently and always have a good recommendation on what beer is next. A few of them pay attention enough to recognize me and remember what I had on the last visit. Coming to the saucer is like hanging out with friends.\\n\\nOne last word of advice - if you're serious about your beer exploration, sign up for the UFO club. For $18 you get a commemorative t-shirt and a membership which clears you from (very infrequent) cover charges and lets you track the beers you have on each visit. Drink 200 different beers and you get your name in the ring of honor, a commemorative plate on the wall, and a $100 tab for a party for you and your friends. There's a reward every 50 - I just earned a free pint - and you get the benefit of trying a ridiculously wide selection of beers and learning more about what the craft has to offer. You will find new favorites and probably a few that you can't stand. But that's the point of the journey, now, isn't it?\\n\\nSo bottoms up, there's a lot to drink.

However, the people who run this location are entirely incompetent. \\n\\nFirst problem: Since I already had a reservation, I was forced to use this extremely bizarre video chat system where I picked up what equaled a pay phone and video chatted with a representative.

They just kind of pointed and said, \\\"It's near the fence.\\\" Um, the entire place is surrounded by a fence! \\n\\nThird problem: They gave us no inspection paperwork. We had to get in the car, drive around and ask for it and then inspect the car ourselves. They took the paperwork afterwards, but who knows what they did with it!\\n\\nFourth problem: We returned the car 1 hour late, which meant we incurred a $30 fee for a late return. I understand that this is the policy, but didn't know before hand. The manager said he could do nothing except give me a gift certificate. Tough luck for me since I already swore up and down that I would never rent from Hertz again.  I resolved to call when I returned home.\\n\\nFifth problem: I called and emailed customer service about my charge. WHen I finally got a hold of someone, they told me that there was nothing they could do since I already accepted the gift certificate, and because I accepted it, it meant that I agreed the issue was resolved.\\n\\nThat's when I was really incensed since no one ever said that by accepting the certificate that I agreed I was OK with being charged $30/hour.

It wasn't. In fact, to say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Where to start? We had a reservation for 8 and they even called us to confirm. But when we showed up, they made us wait for 15 minutes and there was nowhere TO wait because the bar was full of other diners in the same position. Waiting for their tables to turn. Pacing wasn't much better after we were seated as we watched our waiter do a series of odd jobs other than wait on tables (never mind ours) for 20 minutes. We only had water and menus. The menu isn't so long that it takes 20 minutes to make a choice. When we finally ordered, the food came quickly, but that was my next disappointment. My shrimp dumplings were only OK, and frankly tasted previously frozen. The halibut main course was a nice but TINY piece if fish, and the sauce flavors were almost too subtle. If I'm going to pay $29 for an entree, I expect more than six or seven bites of food! The highlight of the meal actually was dessert. We had a lemon marscapone cake with blueberry frozen yogurt and candied almonds which was superb! The flavors blended perfectly and the cake was light and moist. \\n\\nOther than the food lacking that \\\"fine dining\\\" perfection I would have expected, the space itself is awful.

Maybe the economy has them packing people at the bar to up drink sales ( and overbooking to do it), maybe we hit an off-night,  I don't know, but I wouldn't go back. I should have gone back to Ratcliffe on the Green instead. That is a fine-dining experience. Barringtons was not.\\n\\nADDENDUM: I just re-read other reviews and wonder if I even ate at the same restaurant (yes, I know it WAS Barringtons, don't worry, I'm being sarcastic)! There was no four course option where we would get selections chosen by the chef, the chef never made an appearance, it was not quiet and intimate, it was loud, stuffy and decidedly \\\"suburban,\\\" and the fact that people don't seem to mind dropping $150 for salad and pasta, or appetizer and tiny entree is astounding to me when there are such amazing meals to be had in Charlotte for the same or LESS!", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The review shows negative emotion as the author expresses disappointment with the restaurant experience.

Orange marinated fennel and sauce introduced a citrus flavor that added to the layers of the dish yet didn't overpower it. \\n- Tomato soup: delightfully fresh, highlighting natural tomato sweetness, topped with chiffonades of basil, and for a southern twist fried mozzarella balls. Amusement point was the presentation: with the 2 balls for eyes and olive oil half arch below, it looked like a smiley face. Hub and I shared and they split it into 2 bowls for us which was great since he had a bit if a cold. Heard from other tables you could get a half bowl as well. \\n- Roasted garlic: loved the cloves sitting on the table. Tender and mellow enough to spread on warm sliced bread: perfect start to a meal. \\n- Pumpkin waffle with maple ice cream: festive fall dessert and presentation with berries scattered all around. Chose it for the waffle which was great, but star was that house made maple ice cream: bursting with sweet maple flavor with a creamy texture. \\n- Wine list: heavy on great napa/sonoma ones so of course we approved ;-) \\n- Atmosphere: small comfortable dining room. Upscale refined food but no stuffiness came along with it which is my favorite combo. Saloon doors to the restroom amused me. \\n- Service: wait staff knew their dishes and explained them in detail\\n\\nLowlights: \\n- Not on opentable.com: my preferred way to make reservations and usually just go to places that have that option.

I think my living room is bigger.  In total, there were only 9 groups in the entire place and they were at capacity and we were less than a foot away from the group dining next to us (who were rather uppity and kept looking at us as if we were intruding on their dining experience by sitting near them) so I understand why they require reservations.   I would say the average age of the people dining was around 50-60+.  I felt a little young being there, but I wasn't treated that way by the staff, it was more from the patrons, who I think were a little full of themselves (most had that 'I'm SO important' vibe going on.)  \\n\\nI did not get the pretentious air at all from the staff that I was expecting while I was at the restaurant, but I did while making the reservation (don't contact them online or leave a message, they don't call you back and the people on the phone aren't very pleasant -they were even snippy when we called to confirm the reservation).  \\n\\nI had the shrimp with the cole slaw and corn bread for an appetizer.  While it sounds like an odd mix, I was actually sad when I finished it.  I don't even like cole slaw and I was tempted to start licking my plate just to get the last parts that I couldn't pick up with my fork.  For my main course I had the chicken with spinach and mashed potatoes.  Yum. Yum. Yum.  Everything had so much flavor and tasted fresh.  All of us at the table ordered something different and every serving was met with mmm's to near moaning so I think my entire party was pleased with their meal. The food is excellent and the portions are large (the mussels appetizer could be a meal) so you aren't left feeling hungry and bitter and when the $$$ check shows up.

I confronted her about her lack of attention and being disrespectful. She stated it was busy and that other people needed her attention too we weren't the only people there. There were 6 people total sitting at the bar including our party. Even then she continued to have her conversation with the manager about (Facebook, instagram ect.)

The bar tender proceeded to tell us that someone needed to pay it and it wasn't going to be coming out of her money.

At that point I had informed the manager that I had been recording this circus act unfolding in front of me. Her response was \\\"awesome\\\".

I was afraid to drink all of my water, as I didn't think I would be getting a refill.  I was not a fan of the service, I was in there for over an hour and all I ordered was a sandwich and a piece of pie.  But slowness isn't the worst of the waitress traits (I will get to that...)\\n\\nThe food:\\nRoasted Beef Tenderloin sandwich with fries ($10) - (pictured) The first bite was delicious with a bite of soft bread, grilled onions, crispy onions, pepper jack cheese, herbed mayo and tender, well-flavored beef.  The second bite was stringy steak.  The third bite the meat was a little tougher.  Overall it wasn't a bad sandwich at all.  Pretty well balanced, although maybe a little spicier than I would have liked for a tenderloin sandwich.  The fries were fine, standard fries, nothing special, and served with a tiny cup of ketchup that was enough for exactly half of the fries.  Had I seen my waitress before I was almost done eating, I would have asked for more.  3/5\\nChocolate Silk Pie ($4) - The description said it was a creamy white and dark chocolate mousse on Oreo cookie crust.  Drizzled with chocolate and I think raspberry sauce, along with some fresh strawberry slices scattered about, it was mostly frozen.  It reminded me of a Carvel ice cream cake.  It wasn't bad, well-presented, but wasn't what I was expecting. 2.5/5\\n\\nNothing was bad, but nothing was spectacular, however everything seemed to be reasonably priced and included crab cakes and scallops, which my mother loves, so I would have made a return trip toting her along.

I thought perhaps we were early, but throughout our meal only one other table with two customers were there and when they left a mother and daughter came in towards the end of our meal.  Our waiter was friendly, he came to refill our waters twice.  Other than that we really didn't see him.  I was a bit disappointed in the selection. There were 3 vegetarian /vegetable options, 3 chicken options and a couple of of other things like soup, potato wedges, and rice pudding that was extremely soupy. I am a vegetarian, so I was already limited in my choices.  At one point I went back to get some more rice and the rice was never refilled, so I was literally scrapping the bowl!  I mostly ate a dish with broccoli in a tomato sauce, which was by far my most favored item on the day's buffet menu.  While I did have an enjoyable time with my roommate, my taste buds were not jumping for joy as I had previously imagined that they would.  I love Indian food, but my experience at Bombay Grille was although not horrible, was also not what I would envision as something to be repeated.\\n\\nNormally at buffets I can usually eat between 2-3 plates.  Their food was extremely heavy and could only eat one full plate.  After leaving the restaurant I took a nap and very long walk afterwards, and I still was full to the point of being uncomfortable.  I am grateful that I did not have to work that day, I would have been miserable.  I even thought that possibly they put heavy cream in their food, but of course I am not in their kitchen, so that will go unknown.  Food has never made me feel that way.  \\n\\nKey points that I was disappointed in were:\\n1. Buffets usually have a great selection, so that a person can sample several different dishes- Bombay Grille failed here.\\n2. Indian buffets usually have at least one dish with paneer- Bombay Grille failed here.\\n3. Indian buffets are supposed to have several different curry dishes (mild, medium, spicy and different kinds of curry). There was only one curry chicken dish.- FAIL\\n4. Bombay Grille- FAILed to refill the rice.. there were only 4 people in there at any given time!!!!  I'd hate to see what the buffet would like after 20 minutes if it was packed or even half way full.\\n5. Where were the spices? It's bad enough that there wasn't any good curry or paneer, but I couldn't taste any spices.  In my opinion, this is an Americanized Indian restaurant. I could not taste any pepper, cardamon, anise, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, saffron, tamarind or turmeric! -FAIL\\n7. Naan- didn't taste like it was homemade.. looked and tasted like store bought and it was plain.. they didn't have garlic naan!  By the time I had some, it was cold, chewy and blah.  No ghee and naan!  No spices or raisin and naan.  NOT SATISFIED!\\n6. The price for the selection. - FAIL\\n\\nThe decor is slightly plain.. the only redeeming quality was what I was craving for over a month since moving to Charlotte.. a Mango Lassi.\\n\\nOverall, I would not return to this restaurant.. the food quality, selection and price were less than stellar.

It was big, but mostly empty...  which isn't a good sign to me at 12:00 noon on a weekday.  The ladies went ahead and I parked the car.

There were far too many employees on staff for a restaurant with so few patrons.   \\n\\nThey sat us at a booth in the corner.  Our table was served the traditional bowls of watered down hot mustard and pink duck sauce...  the fried noodles were too done almost burnt, a disappointment.  \\n\\nWe had four people at our table. I ordered Hot and spicy scallops, fried rice and an egg roll.  Two people in our party ordered chicken broccoli with fried rice and egg rolls. One ordered chicken with cashews fried rice and an egg roll. The hot and sour soup was delicious and just the right temperature. \\n\\nWhen the food arrived, the portion sizes seemed correct and the fried rice was tasty with egg, peas and pork pieces in it.  I'm sad to say that the rice was the best part of our plates. One person got white rice instead of fried rice as ordered. The waitress did offer to get the fried rice.  My scallops were undercooked and stringy and mushy, I could tell they were almost done but just barely edible. It tasted very much like the brown sauce was burnt.  The egg rolls were overcooked and almost burnt.  \\n\\nThe aquarium was nice and we enjoyed it for a few minutes on the way out. I had eaten here before and it was much better in the past.

I am a peaceful person who would rather cut off my left arm than offend anyone or get into a fight.  But, I swear, B of A brings out a side of me that I wish I never had to see, and the unfortunate part is that I usually end up taking it out on the unsuspecting customer service rep on the other end of the phone line.  I have never in my life banked with a company that goes so far out of their way to screw people over and assess unnecessary fees.  I have paid B of A hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees over the last year due to their screwed up system and logic that they will undoubtedly try to convince you is somehow appropriate.  For example, I made a charge to Food Lion using my debit card and my pin number, which means that charge should come through on my account IMMEDIATELY.  Instead, it didn't come out for two days, on the same day as an automatic withdrawal for a student loan payment.  The financial geniuses at this corporate mega-money factory decided that since they waited for two days to take it out, now they would take the debits out from largest to smallest, with no regard for the date and/or method of payment used.  So, in a nutshell, I was charged two, count 'em two, overdraft fees and when I spoke to customer service, they simply read the policy out of their little manual, attempting to explain it to me like I have an IQ of 50 with no offer to make the situation better even when I threatened to close my account.  Bottom line:  they don't care about me, my money, my life, or my circumstances.  All they care about is whether or not I'm stupid enough to continue paying them overdraft fees.

(If you've never been to Zapata's in University Area before, it can be kinda tricky to locate.  It is in the back left of the plaza.)  When my date and I walked in, we were greeted by a friendly gentleman host, who gave us the option of sitting upstairs or downstairs.  Since we've seen the place before, we chose to sit upstairs.  \\n\\nNo sooner were we seated, when warm tortilla chips, and two bowls of fresh pico were placed before us.  Tecate was on special, so I gladly order one, my date ordered a coke that didn't taste quite right. (YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SODAS.)  Our drinks, including ice-cold water; were brought to us within minutes.  My drink came in a can, however it was accompanied with a frosted-mug and fresh lime.  \\n\\nI order the fajitas-burrito, my date ordered the (grilled) shrimp tacos.  Both orders arrived promptly and smoking hot to our table.   On my plate was a giant burrito stuffed with chicken and steak (I always get the mix), beans, cheese, peppers, and onions, etc.  The outside of the massive burrito was smothered in melted cheeses including guacamole and sour-cream which were splattered across the top.  The shrimp-tacos looked just as appealing.  Both entree's were brought to our tables on extremely hot plates. and were surrounded by warm refried-beans and yellow rice - cooked to perfection.  \\n\\nWe both loved our meals.  We both had plenty to put in a box and take home for a late-night snack or lunch tomorrow.  \\n\\nThere is much debate amongst life-long UCBers about which is the best Mexican restaurant in the University Area; with the contestants being Monterrey, Los Arcos, or Zapata's.

After hearing rave reviews from Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Dominican friends, I finally got the opportunity to eat here last night. \\n\\nI arrived around 9:30pm and was sat instantly. we were the only party in the upstairs part. My friend, who is Mexican, chose to get the rice water (forgot the original name) and it was delicious! Chips and Salsa was plentiful, I didn't care for the salsa at all. Tasted bland and watered down to me. The chips were obviously out the bag, which I don't mind but some salt or some seasoning was needed. \\n\\nI ordered the Street Tacos and my friend got the Shrimp Fajitas. He loved his fajitas! Now, my Street Tacos on the other hand is a completely different story. The tortillas/soft taco shells were greasy and cold. I couldn't even eat them. The items inside the taco weren't that great either. Huge strips of chicken that tasted bland, barely there pico de gallo, and a sprinkle of cheese. There was lettuce and guac on the side. I also asked for sour cream on the side to try to make it taste good. It also came with rice and beans. The beans were beans, nothing special. The rice was the best part of the meal... but it was room temperature which I didn't like much.\\n\\nService is the reason why I will never give the food another chance. Our server was Ingrid. She was pretty great at first. When a Spanish speaking couple came to sit upstairs, she began talking to them so me and my friend had to wait about 10 minutes for the check once we were done eating. Then, she assumed the checks were together and seemed to have a shocked look on her face when I asked to get them split. We had to wait about another 10 minutes for her to finish talking to her manager/co-worker. The thing that that really put the icing on the cake was seeing a charge for sour cream. I wouldn't have minded if I knew when ordering sour cream with my tacos that there would be an extra charge, but to me that is just Serving 101 to tell a customer that all add ons were extra. Paying $1.25 to attempt to make the tacos taste a little bit better was ridiculous. When asked about it she told me, \\\"All add ons have a charge to the ticket\\\". No attempt to atleast say, \\\"I'm sorry, but sour cream has a charge.\\\" I just don't like being surprised when the ticket comes. There was a man, maybe the expo manager or kitchen manager that refilled our chips, salsa, and drinks. I'm not the greatest tipper, but I always tip 25-50% on inexpensive meals so I felt obligated to leave a note telling her that I would've tipped if I knew about the charge and if I could've got the ticket faster instead of watching her chit chat literally right in front of me while waiting for my ticket One of the first times in a while that I didn't tip.

When that one didn't fit, I realized the wheel was the problem. When I called Discount Tire, they said of course it doesn't fit, you have one of our stock wheels on. Had it been explained to me that the wheel wouldn't fit the hubcap I was VERY clear that I wanted, I never would have purchased it!\\n\\nThey assured me this would be fixed, and that they would not only order me the correct wheel, but would take off the cost of the wheel I had already purchased. I gave them a month, and called back to inquire as to the status of my order.

When I called again this month, I was told that they didn't have an order for me out at all, there was no note on my account about any of this, and they had no idea what I was talking about.

First, I waited in line for 10 minutes to pick up the script- there was one person at the counter and two other people ahead of me.  When I finally got to the counter, the script wasn't ready even though it had been called in over an hour before I arrived (what's the hold-up?).  The Pharmacy Technician yelled for them to expedite it (great!) and told me to have a seat while they finished filling the script.  Ok.  I sat and listened... and listened... after 10 minutes I asked another Pharm Tech approximately how long it would be until my script was ready.  He looked and told me it was ready.  I asked why nobody had called me and he said he didn't know.  I got back in line again to check out... this time there were five people ahead of me.  After waiting another 15 minutes there's finally only one person ahead of me... the lady at the counter has a cart load of items and the Pharm Tech asks if she'd like to pay for her items there.  I can't say I blame the customer- if I had other items, I wouldn't want to wait in another line, but seriously, there's quite a line of people who can't check out up front at the general registers- let's serve the people to need to use the pharmacy.  She checks out and then proceeds to question the price of baby-wipes (buy one get one half off that didn't ring out as such).  So now the only person checking people out at the Pharmacy is doing a price check for baby-wipes while the rest of us continue to wait.  Finally, a second Tech arrives and takes the woman in front of me and then takes me.  I explain to him my frustrations as it has taken me over 30 minutes to pick up my script and that NOBODY called me when the script was ready.  The Pharmacy Manager tells me that she did call me and I didn't hear her.  I told her I was sitting in the chairs and nobody called her.  She proceeds to say she speaks fast and I probably didn't understand her.  I'm from New York- we don't know how to speak anything except fast- don't insult me!  I continued to explain my frustrations- having to wait in line twice, nobody telling me the script was ready, etc.  She asked how she could address the situation but at that point there was nothing they could do- I had already spent nearly 40 minutes picking up a script that the doctor had called in over an hour before I even arrived.  At this point, I just wanted to get out.  As I left, another customer told me how rude  I was and that I needed to be more patient!  Haha!  Mind your own business- I don't have time to spend 40 minutes picking up a prescription!  When I got home, I was told that CVS has called to say the script was ready- yup, even though I was sitting less than five feet from the counter, they called HOME rather than me!  This pharmacy needs a lesson in customer service and efficiency because both were seriously awful.  I mentioned that I am new to the area- I recently relocated from Chicago and always used CVS there.  My doctor would call in a script and within 10 minutes, the CVS would have it filled (the time it would take me to walk the 2 blocks from my doctor's office to the CVS).  The couple times the CVS was backlogged, they'd have me take a seat but as soon as the prescription was ready, they'd call me up and check me out immediately- I NEVER had to wait in line TWICE!!!

I haven't had the chance to sit on the floor yet, so I won't include that in my review.\\n\\nYou make your selections off the menu and have some time to sit and chat with other people at the table. Their iced tea is always perfect (whether you get sweet or not), and your glass is always full. \\n\\nThe 1st items to come out are the ginger salad and soup. I normally pass on the soup, but I love their ginger salad. It's not over powering with ginger like most dressings that are in this category.\\n\\nNext comes the appetizers and sushi. I would recommend the calamari steaks (but don't take left overs home, they don't save well) and for the sushi, try the one that has \\\"Pacific or Pacifica\\\" in the name (sorry, I can't remember what it's called). Every time my husband and I have their sushi, it's always fresh and tastes wonderful. \\n\\nThe entertainment begins when the chef comes out to cook your meal. I like how they confirm your order and they pay special attention to any modifications that you've made to your order. This part is great for kids. They cut the tails off of the shrimp and throw them in their hat, light an onion stack on fire and make a train noise with the spatula, and they do an egg roll before throwing it in the air and breaking it in half on the spatula! The meal portions are reasonable and get extra shrimp sauce (it's the pink stuff)! Of course, everything is nice and hot when it hits your plate and fresh because it's cooked right there in front of you.

I will keep going back until they close! I do have to point out, if you're not careful, the bill can get a bit high if you keep adding all the goodies they offer.

I commend this restaurant for taking actions to minimize the amount they spend. This nice restaurant I believe sunk $5 million dollars on the property. Now, I'm going to update my review from my 2011 review. And the outcome, as you can tell by the stars is ummm... not good.\\n\\nNow, lets start off by the menu. I came with a party of 5 and we all got seated down at the hibachi grill. Menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes. I came to Nakato because from word, the owner owns a farm out in Colorado and farm raises all the animals and also their freezer blast freezes their seafood. This is an important fact because when you blast freeze seafood, it's usually 50 or more below 0 degrees Fahrenheit keeping the seafood fresh and bacteria free. So, this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out.\\n\\nSo, lets get back to the menu. Looking at the items something pops out. Fried Rice..$1.75. So, fried rice doesn't come standard with the meal that costs $15+? Steam rice on the other hand is free (which I picked). I ordered the combination of Chicken and NY strip. My party all got the fried rice when it was asked because they were under the assumption that it came with the meal, and I'll break down to you what that fried rice consisted of.\\n\\nFried rice: Eggs, Sesame seed, and Soy Sauce. That's it. No green onions, carrots, and all that other good stuff. On top of the lack of extras with the fried rice it had no taste. Bland.\\n\\nMeats that I ordered weren't bad on the other hand, but the portions were a little too small in my opinion. Their noodles that also came with the meal wasn't filling, and just left me a feeling of not full but at the same time not hungry. And mind, I ate two of my party's portion on noodles.\\n\\nWe also had some tempura. The tempura, I had no taste for it. I've definitely had better. The batter had no taste, as well as the sauce. The veggies that was served in the batter surprised my mother, which found out it was just a whole half of an onion dipped and fried in the tempura. She also wanted to tell me that what made it worse was that the onion had no flavor, the batter, and on top of all that the sauce!\\n\\nFinally lets get on with the end when we pay our bills.\\nSitting with us at our grill was another party of 5, 3 kids and 2 adults. One of the child's birthday happened to be that day. So, you usually get a dessert, or a cupcake, or some ice cream right? Not here! This lucky girl got a nice candle, in a sauce dish. Well, they did sing the birthday song to her.\\n\\nBut wait! That's not it! The table sitting directly across from us also had a birthday. So, they take the candle the little girl just blew out and lights it again to give it to the other birthday person. Mind, these meals cost I believe $15+. Easily.\\n\\nWay to cheap out your customers there, Nakato. Charge extra for fried rice that's bland, and some pretty expensive dishes, with no complimentary birthday dessert.

There are no desserts.\\nThere is a good selection of beer & mixed drinks -- nothing fancy, but adequate and fairly priced for your average sports fan.\\nThe staff is very friendly and professional and are able to accomodate large crowds with ease -- given a little advanced notice.

Since it just so happened none of us had been to MG in a while, we decided this would be our spot (we used to go regularly as a group when we still worked together at a nearby office).  Things have changed.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE:\\nThey still have this going for them.  This is one of the main reasons we used to gather here to begin with.  Still a great place to just kick back in a booth, relax with friends or loved ones, and not worry about having to be too quiet or having to talk over deafening music and patrons.  Noise level is just right, which is greatly appreciated.  Few places are able to balance debauchery and civility so well.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nWe had a great waitress. She was really on-point, even as the crowds increased, being neither too obtrusive nor inattentive.  One thing I really appreciated was that she attempted to quickly \\\"get to know us\\\" a bit--this helped her help a few of US make decisions when too many things looked yummy or weren't in the mood for anything specific.   Friendly. Prompt. Attentive. Knowledgeable. What more could you ask for?!\\n\\nFOOD:\\nNOT WHAT IT USED TO BE.  Don't get me wrong, it's still palatable; HOWEVER, you can tell the quality has diminished drastically.  I ordered the Mediterranean Olives ($2) in citrus marinade as an appetizer. Must say I really enjoyed those (sodium warning...whew!).  Another ordered the fried calamari appetizer ($9).  This was a disappointment.  While the price was average/reasonable, one expects more than just a few bland, nearly tasteless rings of the stuff.  It was mostly the tentacle ends of the poor lil' squid.  And lots of them.  Odd.  Her lobster ravioli ($18) was yummy according to her (looks a tad skimpy, but said it was quite filling).   My Pasta Milano ($12) was nothing like it used to be.  It's now made with rigatoni instead of bow-tie. In-and-of-itself, that's no big deal, but if you're a 'pasta person' you know how specific types of pasta can make a dish (along with the texture).

Then within the next 15 minutes, he brings out our drinks, one by one...30 minutes in, we finally get the freshly baked foccacia bread (which is really the only thing I like about Macaroni Grill). 45 minutes in, FINALLY takes our damn order. I was so irritated but tried to keep my cool since I was with coworkers. I asked about the pasta sampler which only caught my eye because of the proscuitto mac and cheese. It also included the sausage quadratini and carmela's chicken. I decided to order that to get a variety. We all ordered salads as well to start. About 20 minutes later or so, the diet coke I ordered never came, so I asked for it. Then he slowly brings one salad out at a time. REALLY? First one, no dressing. Second one, no bleu cheese. Third one, no bleu cheese or pancetta. Fourth one, no ranch dressing on the side or pancetta. Mine, no pancetta. Only the caeser salad was the one that came out how it should be. About...30 minutes later (we were there for over 2 hours...we had no issues talking and hanging out, but it was getting ridiculous!) our food finally came out. As the manager started bringing out the dishes, I mentioned that our salads were all wrong (I finally mentioned as I didn't want our food to be \\\"messed up\\\"), and he apologized. Then a server starts to hand me a dish that was completely off and not mine. So...I got to wait for 15 minutes while they re-created my dish, and being the slowest eater of the group, I was tempted to just take it to go. Another dish did not have the mozerrella cheese she had requested. When my food finally came, it was all lacking in flavor. The mac and cheese was as dry as can be, boxed mac and cheese would probably have been better, and I think there were two chunks of proscuitto, the size of a penny. I barely touched my meal, and pushed it aside.\\n\\nWhen the bills came, I had heard him say they took the salads off the bills, which was great.

Check in was smooth, though the front desk guys were not very friendly, but just doing their job.  \\n\\nOddly, the room was nicer than I was expecting and the bed was decent too.

It is around $60 for the office visit, any blood work or testing is OUTRAGEOUSLY priced, and even the vaccinations have run much higher than I have ever paid in my life. In one year, I spent more than $2000 in testing, bloodwork, and medication for my dog who was diagnosed with Cushings Disease.  \\n\\n2. No set vet - Please don't get me wrong, I understand there are times when you have multiple vets an office and sometimes they need to cover for each other or consult each other.  However, you have no set vet there, as far as I know.  Any vet could be handling your animal.  It really stinks when you have gotten attached to a particular vet and you can't always see or talk to that vet.  I worry that this affects the quality of care than my animals get there.\\n\\n3. Boarding - So, the last time I have ever boarded my dog was here, and the experience was bad enough that I will now never board my animal again.  My dog had been the vet here and been prescribed medication by the vet for his Cushings disease.  I left specific instructions on his medications and included more food than he would ever really need.  All the food was given to him, more than he probably needed, and of course several doses of his medication were not given to him.  He was there for 5 days.  The manager of the kennel was understanding, and he did refund one day of boarding and the medication fees I paid.  Well, considering each day of boarding is $25 (which seems expensive for the care he got) and I had already paid $125, this was better than nothing but still did not make up for this mistake, as my dog spent a miserable and restless time there.\\n\\n\\nI still appreciate that they participate in a lot of community events, and it is handy that you can do so much online there with the pet portal.

As I am sure most dog owners can relate, they become a part of our family, and after 13 years, a part of you. With the passing still raw in the family with my wife and daughter, seeing our dead dogs name, being used in an advertisement, without our permission was disgusting. \\n\\nThe response from Stoney Creek???     Sorry that was sent from our corporate office in California, must have been done before our records updated.   I don't want your excuse of corporate sending something, when we started coming here there was no \\\"corporate\\\" in California.\\n\\nAll VCA cares about, yes they are known to me now as just VCA, the Stoney Creek we went to does not exist anymore,  is the money.\\n\\n Find a consistent vet, one who knows your animals, and is not trying to rip your wallet out of your pocket the entire visit.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The text showcases negative emotion as the reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the increased prices and decreased service quality at the VCA animal hospital, feeling pressured into expensive procedures and disrespected when declining them, and being upset by the use of their deceased dog's name in an unsolicited advertisement."}

I'm so glad we split it. Definitely enough for two people (and my husband is an eater too!). Good steak, well seasoned. Side was good too. Nothing special but good.\\n\\nJust some things I noted that were kinda off:\\n-We didn't say anything about this cause in the end, we didn't care that much. However, they seated us at the booth that shares the wall with the kitchen/server station area. It was pretty loud.....and there were servers standing like 3 feet from us chatting....and dishes banging. At one point, someone in the kitchen dropped a crap ton of silverwear. It was so loud, I jumped out of my seat haha. Pretty distracting. I mentioned to my husband that if we were a couple that never went out very often and we were going out for a special meal, I would be pretty upset, cause we could barely hear each other. We got there at like 5:30 and there were plenty of other seats in the place.....I would only use that table to seat people as a last resort. \\n-Our waitress was kinda non-existent. Basically, she brought us a menu, initial drinks, food, and check. Which is kinda odd considering the serving station was a mere 5 feet from us! My water was empty for most of the meal and it never got refilled. Not a huge issue cause I did have my wine :)\\n-Lastly, I don't know if I even have the right to mention this. I mean we did split a meal and that isn't how most couples do it. However, they brought out one salad and one meal. Like no extra dishes, no splitting anything, etc. I mean we are super laid back people so we never said anything and just dug in and ate. However, afterwards, both of us mentioned it to each other. The salad was so big. They could have easily split the amount of lettuce and dressing and just put it in two bowls so we werent reaching across the table. It would have just created one extra dish to clean...big deal.\\n\\nIt's little things like the above that can make or break an experience....especially when there are soooooooo many restuarants in the area.

Although the place looks nice, after searching many places this one seemed to be the best, although we were not overly impressed. She needed to get out of the hospital within 2 days.  I have hesitated saying anything ,because  there are some nice employees there. My Mother's experience was one of total neglect. Aside from being served molded bread on several occasions, they would also bring her meal tray, drop it and go, even though she could not even reach the tray. I think the most overwhelming problem is apathy on the part of employees. If it was not for my sister who was there daily, nothing would have been done. As she could not walk during this time, she was wearing protective diapers with a pad on the bed. On several occasions my sister went in and my Mother had been sitting in her urine for several hours. She even got a sore on her back from it. When my sister removed the pad it was so saturated from sitting for several hours that it fell apart. My Mother needed water. She would call someone. They would always tell her they would be right there. Once a nurse came in and said she would be right back. An hour later she called again and asked what happened. They told her that nurse went to lunch. Now, if this was one or two incidences I might not complain, but this was daily. One nurse came in and told my Mom, \\\"You stink.\\\" Those were her exact words. I would like to know what she would think if someone said that to her Mother!

{"id": "66171444c7c6338d323cf47f37d1d09a", "question": "A very coo place, with plenty of indoor rock climbing walls. I first went there with my brother Matt. He dragged me there, because he'd been there before and said it was pretty awesome, me, well I was a little scared of heights.  But not anymore, thanks to InnerPeaks (Just kidding I'm still scared of heights, but that's what makes life exciting, right?)  To get started I had to rent the climbing equipment, including shoes, harness, belays, etc, I think it came to a total of around $25.  then it was go time.  I was a little nervous and I guess the guy at the desk could smell fresh meat, cause he asked me if it was my first time, and I cannot tell a lie, so I told him it was.  Then they took me to a nook of the main floor, which is like a gymnastics floor covered in huge rock climbing walls.  It smells of chalk and the floors are soft and covered in carpet.  I was walked to a corner of the room, near the lockers and watched a video about the proper climbing and belaying procedures, always be in communication with your belay partner...\\\"Climb On\\\"!\\nThen it was off to the walls...Inner Peaks has a ton of different walls for varying skill levels.  I started with the beginner walls which have a slight slope and aren't completely vertical like some of the intermediate walls.  After summitting the first wall I was exhilarated,overcoming my fear of heights and using my brain and muscles to find my way to the top.  So I moved onto the bigger walls toward the front of the place. It had more difficult grips, spaced in a more challenging way, after some effort I made it to the top of this wall, as well.  Rock climbing is an awesome sport, great exercise, challenging both mentally and physically and it helps you use all of your muscles, especially your legs,fingers and forearms.  But that could also be because I'm not using the proper technique.\\nEither way InnerPeaks is awesome, not only do they have some hard core walls that wrap around the entire interior of the building, but they also have little stations where you can work on your grips, techniques and strength training.

My family and I went to this place Saturday evening based on the reviews here on Yelp and other sites such as Urbanspoon.  4 of us ordered chicken Parmesan, a pretty good yardstick for determining how the food is in any Italian restaurant.

We should have been tipped off when the chicken was grilled not breaded as is the case with this dish.  BLAND.  GROSS.  TERRIBLE.  Now comes the part that totally caused me to write this.  We sent it all back.  We were asked \\\"would you like something else?\\\".  Not a chance.  If this was the indicator for the so called cuisine we wanted nothing to do with it.  The \\\"manager\\\" came to our table.  \\\"You have to pay for the entire meal\\\".  Seriously?  Seriously!  Now again in 99% of the time when food is returned, the normal proper way of doing business is to say \\\"sorry you didn't like your food.  We will deduct the cost from your bill\\\".  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.  In the face of protecting my family from the embarassment of the police being called, I paid $83 for this CRAP. $83!!!  As I left I suggested the manager change this policy.

{"id": "d2545b12e88d32946e30124dbf0dfd1e", "question": "I am confused. I am baffled. I am in shock. I am disappointed.  \\nWhen I read the reviews I was a little surprised but I figured somehow I must have looked over this place after all these years and I was actually regretting it!  Now...not so much. I quickly realized there was a reason I grew up right around the corner yet never visited this place.  I realized there was a reason I never even stepped foot in this place on a lunch break while working at the neighboring Food Lion as a squeaky teenager with braces. Back then I thought Ragu was gourmet so I wasn't even picky but STILL knew to stay away from Juliana's  There is a reason why our Italian family of 7 never bothered ordering from here even though it was cheap and close by!  You have to realize this was before the restaurant scene really even popped off in Charlotte!! There were no options!  Uptown was downtown, the arboretum was for the wealthy and Ballantyne didn't exist.  But still....Juliana's was never an option....now I see WHY!!\\n\\nWe opened the door and immediately fell back into 1973.  The diner feel of this place gave me the creeps and the whole restaurant turned to stare as we entered.  It was awkwardly quiet and just didn't have a comfortable feel AT ALL.  I wanted to leave from the moment I stepped in but I figured I needed to get over myself and give it a try.  Sometimes the best food comes out of little hole in the wall restaurants.  I wasn't expecting much but I realize decor is not the only thing that matters.\\n\\nWe decided to stick with the absolute basic.  I ordered Spaghetti and meatballs and my husband ordered the chicken parm 12 inch sub.  My husband isn't as picky as I am so I was counting on him to enjoy this sub.  It is pretty hard to mess up a chicken parm sub.\\n\\nMy pasta came out and all I can tell you is that the sauce was brown.  It looked like gravy.  When I mixed it in with the spaghetti it somehow just vanished so it was basically like eating noodles with a hint of brown gravy.  It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted.  I took one bite of the meatball and thought I was going to throw up.  It was atrocious.  It was spongey and tasted like deer meat.  It was so gross.  My husband's chicken parm sub had the same doo-doo brown gravy on it and the chicken was like rubber.  Literally.  He could hardly bite through it.  When he said he couldn't eat this sub, I KNEW it was bad.  He eats anything.  I for darn sure wasn't eating my dish so we just sat their staring at each other.  I forgot to mention the salad and texas toast that was served with the meal...the salad was frozen iceburg with nothing else and the toast was a piece of lilly white bread with some butter and garlic slapped on it.  BLLLLEH!!!!\\n\\nEventually the waitress made her way over to us and we weren't sure what to say but I can tell you I have only not been able to eat a meal due to COMPLETE dissatisfaction twice in my whole life.  The waitress noticed that we didn't eat our meals and asked if we wanted a box to go.  Um, WOW.  No, we want to just get out of here.  We asked for our check and told her we weren't really satisfied but that we didn't want to make a big deal, no need for managers, etc.  Well, one of the \\\"managers\\\" (son to the woman who owns and cooks) came over.  He offered us anything else off the menu to replace our meals.  We didn't want anything else from this dump.  We wanted to just LEAVE and go eat.  We were starving and on a time crunch.  \\n\\nLong story short--They made us pay for the meal that we didn't even touch.  The owner came out and was extremely nasty.  She said she posted that they do not refund for food.  She then pointed to this itty bitty note on her cash register.  She said she can't please everyone's taste buds so she is not going to refund anyone.  What?  So does this happen often enough that you have to have a disclaimer on your food?  That is TERRIBLE servie for a small mom and pop, or just mom shop.  It was like they were used to people not liking their food so they were prepared to argue their point.  IT was bizarre.  I don't understand that concept.  They said you can order a pizza or something else so they are still losing money by having to make a whole other meal!  Either way, it was their approach and the fact that the food was absolutely disgusting.  I would NEVER want to support this place, local or not.\\n\\nI asked them where they were from because no one that was born and raised in Italy would have created the mess that they did.  They were actually greek.  I suppose they just have a different way of preparing Italian food because it was NOT authentic.\\n\\nI looked back at those who offered such stellar reviews and realized that most of the people were from random towns/areas.  Maybe they haven't been exposed to the real deal in terms of Italian food so somehow this place was okay to them.  Not me.  I'm telling you...If you love Italian food and have had real authentic Italian food...DO NOT GO HERE.

You can tell from the general exterior decor that this place was probably last remodeled back in 1975.... but I'm not going to pass judgement on that. As we all know, sometimes places like this can have excellent food, be quite charming, and a good time.\\n\\nSince it's November, it was dark, and there of course was no outside seating.... no boats bobbing in the water... so other than a nice clear night with glassy water in the moonlight, there was not much to see. We did get seated at a very nice window seat, thanks to the hostess, who had orders barked to her by the \\\"manager\\\", who resembled a female version of Jabba The Hut from Star Wars... I felt bad for the hostess.\\n\\nI think the food was very good.... I had the Fantail Shrimp, our son a burger, and my wife the Gorgonzola/Walnut stuff chicken. We had an appetizer of the stuffed mushrooms. As far as the food goes, the mushrooms were probably really the only letdown of the evening.... slightly over-priced and underwhelming.... the gravy they were sitting in left much to be desired..... not terrible..... but not $9.95 appetizer good.....  ya know???\\n\\nInitially, when we sat, our server greeted us promptly, which I thought was great.

There were a few, since of course she hadn't been around to gather anything through the course of dinner. Since she couldn't take them all, she left a stack of dirty plates on our table - disgusting.  \\n\\nAt that point, I laid down 4 crisp $20's for our $75-ish tab, and we got the heck outta there...... as we departed the \\\"manager\\\" (Jabba The Hut) wished us good night in a very un-caring tone, and we noticed upon leaving the dinner specials - not mentioned to us by our server at all!!!!  Absolutely terrible.\\n\\nSo.... this place could be a solid 3-ish.... IF you get a good server... and if it's summer, and you sit outside, and it's nice..... you might hit a 4.

They worked with other local businesses, like Batch Bakehouse, and also didn't bat an eye when I suggested two craft cocktails for our bar, one that required the orange peels to be smoked. I wanted to do a lot of the wedding myself and they were happy to allow me to drop off the drink mixes store before the wedding, as well as using my DIY place settings.

I require a side dish of epinephrine if I eat crab, so I appreciate this omission. Now that I have established that I go here just for the cream cheese puffs, it should be clear that I'm far from an expert on Asian food. So take the rest of my review with a grain of salt; there should be plenty to spare in your entree. \\n\\nI used to think this place was ok -- it still has plenty of variety, a very friendly staff, good chili-garlic sauce, decent potstickers, above-average lettuce wraps, no grisly or fatty pieces of meat -- but lately the preparation has been sloppy and the presentation just as bad. I suspect the quality of the ingredients has come down a notch. \\n\\nAfter cream cheese wontons, Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees. My last order looked like Goldilocks's porridge in the \\\"Three Little Bears\\\" Golden Book I had as a kid. Dull gray, soupy, greasy, salty and watery, yet somehow sticky. The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all, which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find, I was hoping to find something else edible. Epic fail on this entree. \\n\\nOn my next visit, I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken, as a side to my beloved wontons. Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side. The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers had no life left. Again, I hunted and pecked for the chicken, which is consistently decent-quality, well-prepared white meat. My wife's veggie fried rice would have been ok -- they ease up on the salt and Valvoline for this entree -- but the vegetables were overcooked and charred in places. Fresh veggies should present as a bright spectrum of colors -- orange from the carrots, bright green from the scallions, broccoli and pea pods, yellow from the corncobettes. Instead, however, they were the same brown color as the fried rice. \\n\\nMy last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's.

For a while, it was the next great thing - there always were long lines of families anxious to get their butterfat and sugar fix.  The buzz has faded and now those same families flock to the local froyo joints to get their frozen dairy fix.  I stopped by this weekend while shopping at Greenway Station and found the store devoid of patrons.  I know it's been a long, cold winter, but we Wisconsinites love our ice cream and Babcock Hall was standing room only when I visited later that same day.\\n\\nSo why does my ice-creaming loving family now generally eschew Cold Stone?\\n* Texture - I really prefer a firm scoop of ice cream and that's not what you get at Cold Stone.  The texture is far too gooey for my liking.  It's not terrible, but I much prefer the denser texture of the product at Babcock Dairy or The Chocolate Shoppe any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  The other textural problem is that Cold Stone ice cream melts too fast, so bring a gross of handi-wipes when bringing the kiddos here. \\n \\n* Flavor - The ice cream here is too sweet.  At Cold Stone, it is all about excess, whether it be about the butterfat content, the sugar content or the oversaturated flavorings.  Again, it's not terrible, but it's just not my cup of tea.\\n\\n* Serving Size - The theme of excess carries over to the over-the-top serving sizes.  While I am not a huge fan of froyo, at least I can control my serving size when I visit the near-by Menchies or Orange Leaf.  In addition, while I'm on the topic of serving sizes, can I just add that I detest the cutesy \\\"Like It\\\", \\\"Love It\\\" and \\\"Gotta Have It\\\" serving size names.\\n\\n* Service - When the place first opened, the staff was energetic and responsive.  I admit it was hokey, but I kinda liked the dorky songs they sang when you left a tip.  But now, a trip to Cold Stone is more like visiting a gulag.  Leaving a tip rarely triggers a response, much less a chorus of \\\"Ice cream, baby\\\" sung to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby.  My other pet peeve is that the tables always seem to be sticky, thanks to the soupiness of the ice cream.  It's really kind of a depressing place to visit now.\\n\\n* Pro tip: If you have a peanut allergy, have them clean the stone before they mix your ice cream or you risk cross contaminating your treat.

Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.

Wood paneling, dated tables and chairs, and GOD AWFUL seventies music piped in. When we walked in(at six on a Saturday night) there was one couple at the bar, and another couple dining upstairs near us. The waiter seated us--close to the kitchen, I realized with disappointment. If I want to hear dishes clanging and the hustle and bustle, I'd be cooking at home. Dining out is for pretending that there's no work involved. It also didn't help that because it was so slow in the restaurant, I could hear every comment the waiter said to the cook-staff, some of which wasn't patron-friendly. \\n\\nThe BF ordered the fried walleye,and I the beef tips Moutarde.

Unfortunately, that's about all it has to offer, unless you enjoy food that is extremely greasy, and of mediocre quality.\\n\\nDetailed review: Our fish fry crew decided to give Stamm House a try after we'd read good things about it on a fairly well known fish fry review website.  Normally, those guys (the reviewers) are pretty spot on, but they've completely missed the mark when it comes to the Stamm House.  Not even close to being a top-10 place, no way, no how.\\n\\nWe sauntered in to the Stamm House at around 5:45 on Friday night and were shocked to find the place darned-near empty.  The bartender greeted us immediately - very friendly guy - we ordered a couple of New Glarus Nakeds and a Spotted Cow.  After downing the first round, we went to order a refill, and whoops - Naked went empty, and there wasn't any more left.  Drat.\\n\\nAfter downing a second round of beers (Cows all around this time), it dawned on us that we probably needed to inquire about a table.  So, we wandered upstairs where a friendly lady told us she'd have an opening at around 6:45 or 7:00.  Odd, the place was empty... but, we took it and went back downstairs.\\n\\nWe ordered some cheese curds and the onion rings.  The bartender warned us ahead of time that the curds were \\\"standard-from-the-bag\\\" curds, but said the rings were hand-battered and delicious.  They arrived quickly, and once again, the bartender was spot-on with his description.\\n\\nThe curds were Sysco curds and were not cooked well at all.  I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them.  Disgusting.  And the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \\n\\nThe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  It really made for a bad first impression.  So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \\n\\nOur table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\\n\\nDinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful.  Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish).  Think \\\"stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor\\\" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \\n\\nSo, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry.  The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  If only it weren't so obscenely fishy...   \\n\\nHash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.

In hindsight, this was probably a mistake.\\n\\nThe buffet features broasted chicken, two types of baked haddock (seasoned/buttered and plain), deep fried cod, several casseroles, some veggies, and several potato options (baked, broasted, or steak fries).

All new equipment and works great. \\n\\nI have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \\n\\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations.

For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed.

They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great.

Although this location carries the Aveda name, it appears to be buckling under its weight. There are many issues at this salon, and only a few will be mentioned here.\\n\\nTangles Salon has had a somewhat tortured existence here in the Madison area, what with experiencing not-so-smooth management changes, relocating attempts, massive employee walkouts, and even a fire in the past 2 years alone. One begins to wonder how they have stayed afloat as long as they have.\\n\\nAfter a devastating fire destroyed Tangles, it was clear that many once loyal customers had been caught in the middle of the chaos. Some arrived at the salon for their appointments, only to find the building in charred ruins, and most never got a courtesy call from the owners. Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.\\n\\nA receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.\\n\\nOn the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.\\n\\nI wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The text shows negative emotion because it highlights numerous issues at Tangles Salon, such as management problems, a fire incident, lack of cleanliness, unprofessional staff, and inconsistent service, ultimately indicating a struggling business."}

I made the appointment and the day before the appointment they contacted me to  tell me that the nail tech that I was scheduled with called in sick.  When I stated that my appointment was for the next day at 11:30 , they indicated that she was going to be out then as well.  Ok, I was fine with this, and they offered to get me in at 2:00 or 3:00.   I indicated that I would have to check my calendar and would call them right back, but she put me in  for 3:00 temporarly.  I called back 10 minutes later to let them know that I could not make 3:00 work due an appointment I had at work and would need to have my pedicure at 2:00.  This was done via voice mail and asked them to call me back to confirm this was still available.  I did not receive a call back, and followed up with a new call to Tangles the following morning, which was the day of my appointment and I left a new voice mail message to confirm that they received my previous voice mail and please call me back.   I did not receive a call, so one would assume that they had me down for 2:00.  I took a late lunch from work, and drove over to their location on Whitney Way which is a good 20 minute drive and when I arrived, was told they had me down for 3:00 and that they were booked and could not get me at 2:00.   At this point I was very frustrated, due to the lack of not responding to my voice mail messages. The receptionist told me she was aware of my calls, but did not have the time to call me back, since they were so busy.    This took an hour of my day, and a gallon of gas to drive there, and  was not offered any  compensation for their lack of not informing me that they were now booked at 2:00, even though I told them I would call right back to confirm either 2:00 or 3:00.      This is the poorest customer service I have ever recieved by far from a salon!!   I wonder how they plan on staying in business, when they treat clients in this matter and have no regard for their time and money, ($3.80 a gallon for gas).  I understand that sometimes it is necessary to adjust an appointment, but the lack of respect for my time is over the top for me.   Also when a salon signs up to offer a Group On deal, I would assume the goal for  doing this is to try and build their business wth new clients.   If they do not have the capablity to handle new clients, then they should not be offering this type of promotion.

Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\\n\\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.

Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.

Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\\n\\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\\n\\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.

First of all, we ordered for delivery tonight, on New Year's Eve. Hey, I get it; NYE is a busy holiday for restaurants, so it's not like I expect a 30 minute delivery time. But when an hour and a half passed without our food, we called to check in. They told us, \\\"Sorry, we only have one delivery driver for more than 30 orders.\\\" Um... ok? Why, when you know it's a holiday, would you not staff more drivers? So that was ridiculous right off the bat. Then, our food arrived (about an hour and 45 minutes after we ordered), and I would have forgiven the long wait had the food been amazing (or even good!). Sadly, this was not the case. I ordered the children's chicken fried rice for my kids, and I was honestly scared to give it to them when I opened the container and saw the cold, gray, limp chicken lying within the rice. My kids tried it and promptly spit it out. My order (the cashew chicken) was limp and spongy; the only slightly passable thing we ordered was the General Tso's chicken. Although even that, while it had excellent flavor on the breading and sauce, provided way more gristle than I expect to ingest when eating from a restaurant. \\n\\nSo we may (if all other options are exhausted) give it another try, because hey, maybe it was just a fluke bad experience because of New Year's Eve.

He fishes primarily for cod and salmon, and supplies several very well known restaurants with his bounty. His fish is top notch and without compare - truly great stuff. \\n\\nHe wanted to try Wilson's, as he doesn't supply them with fish and is always looking for opportunities to expand his distribution footprint in and around the area.\\n\\n+ Huge space. Shockingly huge - rectangular in shape, the building is at least 4-5 times deeper than it is wide. \\n+ Bar runs the entire length of the building\\n+ Nice selection of taps and bottles available\\n+ Was quite surprised to find Abita Strawberry on tap\\n\\n+ Tons of televisions; our high-top had its own TV\\n- Very noisy due to all of the televisions going\\n\\n- All tables were dirty; staff wasn't too good about wiping down after people left\\n- Our server was quite gruff, not terribly helpful, largely absent, and forgot to bring refills of drinks and waters\\n\\nSo... all of that stuff aside, let's talk about the fish.\\n\\nTwo options for fish: 3-piece or 5-piece deep-fried cod. No baked cod, and no other fish varietals. \\n\\n+ The cooking area is in plain view of the entire restaurant\\n- You'll leave smelling like a deep fryer\\n- We watched as our fries sat and languished on plates for a good 5+ minutes while the fish cooked\\n- We watched as our completed plates loitered in the cooking area for another 5+ minutes after the fish was done; our server was busy running around helping other tables while the fish sat...and sat... and sat... \\n- Before we were finished eating, our cranky server began clearing a space directly behind us so that they could set-up for karaoke. That's all well and good, but the guy kept bumping stuff into us (the bar stools don't have backs)... he was like a bull in a china shop.\\n\\n+ Batter on the cod was delicious, if not quite salty. Violet L is a salt fan, and she even commented that it was overly salty\\n- The cod itself was dry, slightly chewy, and meh. My fisherman friend said it was \\\"jerky-like.\\\" He was, however, quite impressed (as were all of us) by how well the batter clung to the cod.

But in the last few years, other venues in Madison have really stepped up their game, and the Barrymore doesn't seem to care about keeping up with its contemporaries.\\n\\nIts use of social media is near-archaic. The venue doesn't make an effort to create or even update pages for individual events, and good luck if you get any indication that a show is on track to sell out. And perhaps it's just my personal taste, but the Barrymore used to bring in excellent music acts on a much more regular basis. Now it just caters to the aging-hippie population of the neighborhood, preferring to fill its schedule with predictable offerings about far-left-leaning politics. These events don't offend my own political views, but they're often dull and serve as nothing more than an echo chamber for people who want their beliefs perpetually reaffirmed. They sell more tickets that way, so I'm not sure I can blame them for the strategy, but  I hardly ever like the shows there. Also, the tickets are 2-3 times more expensive than the tickets usually are at other live entertainment venues in town.\\n\\nThe building itself isn't falling into disrepair, like the Orpheum is (heartbreakingly, I might add), but areas of infrastructure could certainly benefit from attention. There is no public WiFi, and you'll be hard-pressed to get cell phone reception, even in the balcony. I do appreciate that the open dance area is slanted a bit so that we vertically-challenged folks have a chance to see, but if you want to be able to sit and see the acts, the balcony is your best bet. It's not often open, however, especially for shows that haven't sold a ton of tickets. I don't recall this being a problem at prior events, but at the show I attended last night, there were constant problems with microphone feedback, often necessitating acrobatics by the band itself. The tap beer selection is good, but that's pretty standard in this town. Bottled beer selection pales in comparison to other venues, and the liquor and wine options are slim pickings. The bar is cash-only. The only ATM in the place charges a $4 fee for each use, so if you need to withdraw cash, make sure to get enough in one go. The line can be enormous, and often is bisected by people exiting and entering the theater. The bathrooms are fairly clean and well-stocked, although I've used them on more than one occasion to discover that they were out of soap, necessitating the use of their hand sanitizer instead.  Also, the saloon-style doors are an easy way to get smacked in the face entering and exiting the bathroom, so exercise plenty of caution around them. The bathrooms are so tiny that the lines are formed outside the doors. They also don't sell earplugs, so make sure you bring your own.\\n\\nBottom line: in the rare event that they have a show I want to see, I'll go, but I make sure to bring plenty of cash, my own earplugs, and my plastic Barrymore cups (drinks are 50 cents cheaper when you remember to bring your cups back).", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "This text shows negative emotion because the reviewer criticizes the Barrymore venue for its outdated use of social media, lack of diverse music acts, high ticket prices, poor infrastructure, limited drink options, and inconvenient facilities, overall leading to a disappointing experience."}

I'd had past or present Madison residents take issue with my insistence that Pedro's was a great casual dinner place, but I took that as part and parcel of Madison's legendary disdain for anything that's not edgy/hip/contemporary/iconoclastic/whatever. And old-school American-Mexican food is certainly none of the above, plus it represents one of the the greatest societal faux-pas of our time -- *gasp!* -- cultural appropriation! \\n\\nUnfortunately, it turns out any snobbery -- incidental or otherwise -- toward Pedro's may be warranted.

The burrito is smaller than it used to be -- I suppose that's how they've been able to hold the line on prices so the size reduction is probably justified -- but my wife's fajitas were chewy, and both dishes lacked that \\\"kick\\\" that they used to have. Our quesadilla appetizer arrived luke-warm and was nearly rock-hard within minutes.\\n\\nThe premises haven't changed in the nearly 20 years I've been eating there and it's starting to show its age. Service was adequate, no more no less. which would be fine if everything else up to par.  In short, Pedro's lacks that extra spark that used to make it worth a special stop when visiting or passing through town.

{"id": "d95f0f00268b04ebffea71dec530d435", "question": "The Saturday before Halloween is apparently not something the good folks of Madison, Wisconsin take lightly. #Freakfest\\n\\nI found myself in town visiting friends who live in the Madison-metro area and make it a point to celebrate the State street festivities every year. They live about 5 or so miles from the actual fest and because drinking and driving is never in style, they'd gone ahead and arranged a day in advance for 2 cabs to come pick our group of 7 up at their place of residence at 8:45pm. \\n\\nNow, this was my virgin visit to Madison at Halloween time so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, though I can't say I wasn't warned. I knew streets would be closed down and blocked off and this wouldn't be your typical Madison experience, but without seeing the Mad city madness first-hand, it was hard to anticipate just what we were up against when it came to our group versus on-time transportation on this hallowed eve. \\n\\nUnion Cab did miss the mark as far as sending the two cabs that we'd ordered more than a day in advance to arrive at 8:45pm. The first cab arrived at 9pm to pick up the first half of our group off at the fest, but when the first group arrived at said bar and realized that the second group had still not been picked up, they asked if that cab could go back and get us, ya know, since there was supposed to have been another cab there 30 minutes earlier anyway. But the driver said they were unable to locate the second cab and that it was against the rules to come back and pick up the second group who were still waiting since they were not the assigned cab. Makes very little sense, but at the same time is sort of understandable on such a crazy eve, but the reservation should've counted for something. \\n\\nWhen we (the second group still at the house) tried calling Union, all we got were busy signals being that it's one of Madison's busiest cab nights of the year. So naturally, we did the only thing we could... crack open another beer and wait and chug and wait and chug and wait. It was just before 10pm when our cab finally arrived. The driver was super fun, quirky and costumed for the holiday and quickly made us forget about how Union had failed to provide us with transportation until over an hour after the previously scheduled and agreed upon time.\\n\\nAlso worth noting, because it won Union back a lot of stars that would otherwise have been missing given the tardiness, is how immaculate the shiny, gleaming Toyota Prius cab was. It smelled divine, and not overpowering or like it had something to cover up. And -get this- it had cloth seats. CLOTH SEATS. It didn't smell like sh*t. ZERO crumbs. Sans stains. Not even a whiff of urine or vomit. Where the hell was I? Bizarro World, surely. \\n\\nSo, while I don't know that I'd trust Union as my chariot on a big day where I needed to be somewhere in a timely manner (ala the airport), they were plenty fine for a casual booze-bender and the amenities (no puke stains or pee smells) made the ride a pretty enjoyable one.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "This text shows negative emotion because the cab company failed to provide timely transportation despite a reservation, causing frustration and inconvenience for the group.

Why not the in office test first, followed by the other?

I had to get a TB test and showed up as scheduled: 8:30, Easy right? Wrong... let me back up.\\n\\nTo my own fault, I didn't realize there were parking spaces in the back of the building. I ended up parking at the PDQ where the sign clearly states \\\" Parking Only for PDQ Customers. Violators will be towed\\\". Because I'd arrived a bit earlier than my appointment time, I didn't think it would be a long wait and parked my car there ( huge gamble). \\n\\nWalk into the facility and am instantly turned off. I cannot stand being in any kind of office that doesn't give you and the staff member privacy. The line was nearly out the door. Everyone had to get in line just to sign in, THEN take a seat. Once the line was clear, they called you up by name in the order you signed in. This completely defeats the purpose of having an appointment. Does this make sense to anyone? Certainly not me. Keeping in mind... I am parked in a place I shouldn't have parked my car. Afraid to move it, I crossed my fingers I wouldn't be towed or tickets. I didn't to to leave, have them call my name and miss my slot. \\n\\nMy name gets called and I think it's time for my to get my TB. Instead, I must go up and fill out paperwork. Why couldn't this be done sooner? The receptionist was quite rude. She was trying to do too many things as once instead of giving me proper attention. No professionalism at all. At any rate, I filled out the paperwork and went to sit back down. If I am becoming repetitive, it's because my actions were repetitive. \\n\\nOne receptionist, instead of calling the gentlemen to approach the desk, she begins asking him questions across the facility. Not only is this rude but considering the waiting area is the size of an average living area for a home, it causes distractions. Confidentiality should ALWAYS be maintained at such facilities. \\n\\nI am clock watching like crazy and getting nervous. Every second that goes by, I am risking my car being towed. 9am rolls around.... still waiting... 9:10 rolls around... still waiting... Finally at 9:25 I was called. Almost 1 hour AFTER my scheduled appointment time.\\n\\nThe TB shot took 2 minutes. Literally 2 minutes and I was out the door. \\n\\nI am not sure what kind of system Concentra seems to be working with but they need to squash it and rebuild including offering some classes for their front desk staff on learning how to be professional in the work place. \\n\\nA side note, when I went back 2 days laters to get my TB read, the waiting time was 3 minutes which I appreciated. I was also seen by a Medical Assistant Student. I have nothing wrong with this but as a note, please do keep in mind that Concentra does staff students. Some may take no issue with this while others do. Considering it was on a TB read, I was cool about it. That being said, I will NOT be coming back here. I take my confidentiality seriously and hold my health care providers to a higher level. Considering I am paying a crap ton of money for health insurance, I demand better service. If my primary health care provider treated me like I was treated at Concentra, you better believe by that night, I would have dropped my coverage. Avoid this place if you can. If not...

Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison's finest.\\n\\nDetailed Review:\\nThe Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter's Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot.  The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye.  \\n\\nWe put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange.  I'm sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish.  \\n\\nRegardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually.  So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn't a problem.  Dexter's recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. \\n\\nWe immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup.  I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad.  The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could've been a little warmer.  I'm told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good.\\n\\nThe waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp.  He said he'd be back in 10 minutes with our fish.  \\n\\nNearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish.  She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us.  The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter's doesn't strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover.  \\n\\nCurds were excellent - not your typical \\\"from the bag\\\" curds, which was a nice surprise.  They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly.\\n\\nFish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait.  The cod was phenomenal.  Three huge pieces with a mound of fries - now that's what we're talkin' about.  The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful.  The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored.  I loved every single bite of it.\\n\\nI also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp - both of which were excellent as well.  Huge props to Dexter's for their fish fry - it's definitely a top-10 offering.\\n\\nIn the end, they also made things good as the waiter comp'ed us our drinks and curds, so we got out of there for under $40.  We tipped well and called it a night.  I'd definitely go back to Dexter's - sure, they dropped the ball, but they did an honorable thing and made everything right by us.

However, when we went back a month or so later, we had a horrible experience.  We had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food and then when we got it- it was terrible.  My boyfriend had the garlic chili fries and they arrived not only COLD, but DOUSED in disgusting grease- they were inedible.  We mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to bring a new order, but it turned out the new order was just as terrible as the first one.  I had the roast beef sandwich and it was horrible- very dry and bland.  To her credit, the waitress did give us free cupcakes to take home to make up for the horrible food (although it turned out the cupcakes were also inedible and terrible).  \\n\\nWe hoped this was just an unusually busy night and not the norm, and because the fish fry is so good, we went back again tonight, hoping for a better experience.  We were wrong!  We went around 7 and waited 15 min or so for a table.  Once we were seated we placed our order right away with the waiter, since we already knew what we wanted.  An hour later, we were still waiting for our food.  All we ordered was the fish and waffle fries- so nothing complicated- and on such a busy night, you'd think they'd be making sure to keep batches of fish and fries going steadily into the fryer.  When we finally got our food, it was the tasty fish we'd remembered from before, but by that time, we were so tired and crabby from having to wait for so long, it wasn't quite so enjoyable.  After our meal, we had to wait quite a long time for the waiter to bring the check, and then he didn't come back to pick it up for a good 15 minutes.  We would still go back to Dexter's just for drinks, but I don't think we'll be going there to eat the food anymore.  Two terrible experiences with inexcusably long waits is enough to keep us from going back for dinner.

Here are a few things I suggest to make your experience supremely successful:\\n\\n1. Go there with a plan. As you've read it can be overwhelming to navigate the tight aisles with a large cart and huge crowds. Do some research online, look at photos, and make a list of the things you're looking for. It's much easier to shop if you have an idea of what you want. It's sort of like buying groceries on an empty stomach. Imagine spending all day pushing a cart up and down store aisles unable to make solid decisions because of your ravenous hunger. Shopping Klein's with an empty garden or empty pots is similar. Also, tuck your cart in a corner and walk the aisles instead trying to push the cumbersome thing around. \\n\\n2. Go on a day that's a bit overcast. I went twice this summer just before some rain rolled in, and because the sun was tucked behind a few clouds most of the time I was there, it was much more comfortable inside. If you can, look at a weather report and shop when you know it won't be hotter than Hades. \\n\\n3. Don't be afraid to ask multiple people, multiple questions. And if you're not satisfied, tell them! The folks I encountered on my most recent trips wanted to steer me in a direction I wasn't interested in because it wasn't part of my plan, and eventually they guided me to plants that would help me achieve the overall look I was going for on my balcony. It was important for me to realize that certain folks will gravitate towards certain plants simply based on personal preference. I learned to say things like, \\\"I don't like ferns, what else will grow like a fern in an area that doesn't get a ton of sun, but isn't a fern.\\\"\\n\\n4. Take someone who knows what they're talking about. I walked the aisles with a dear friend who happens to be a master gardener and she was instrumental in telling me more about plants, what types would thrive on my balcony, and which to stay away from given the climate change and season transitioning we are experiencing this September. Maybe you don't know a master gardener but have a neighbor with a yard you envy.\\n\\n5. Go outside. I had no idea the selection outside was so vast. And if you don't see it, ask! \\n\\nI hope these tips encourage you to think about giving Klein's a try. And if you're not feeling it next time your there, give it a day or wait until the next weekend and try again. Like plants, trees and shrubs, shopping can be fickle experience depending on a number of factors.\\n\\nI've decided it's a-ok to make multiple trips. \\nRome wasn't built in a day. \\nMy balcony didn't turn into an outdoor oasis after one weekend.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Positive", "rationale": "The review shows positive emotion because the author expresses great pleasure and updates their previous negative review with overwhelmingly positive experiences and helpful tips, encouraging others to give Klein's a try, which indicates a positive sentiment.

Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. \\n\\nThere've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. \\n\\nThen there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. \\n\\nDeli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so.

I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat.

I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. \\n\\nDeli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. \\n\\nYou can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want.

I ordered the lentil soup, and several appetizer portions including hummus, moohamara, sarma, and falafel.    \\n\\nQuick review:\\n- lentil soup.  Awesome, just awesome.  Beautiful saffron color from the cooked down red lentils, just the right mix of cumin and lemon, and a back end of heat, I'm guessing from Aleppo pepper.  This is some thick soup, and filling, and for 2.50, you get a pint\\n\\n- Moohamara.  I wasn't going to get this.  I like roasted red bell pepper, and I've had dips and purees made of them, but I've never sought it out.  Mary, one of the owners, told me it was her favorite, best on the menu.

Huge portion, perfectly deep-fried, with a really nice, light texture.  Love the falafel, but I prefer tahini sauce, and these come with a yogurt mint sauce.  Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\\n\\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \\n\\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.

We started off with soups; I went with the hot and sour soup and my husband chose the won-ton soup. I was extremely pleased with my choice, because in my experience hot and sour soup is a very hit or miss dish. I've tried many I wasn't satisfied with, but their soup had a wonderful, vibrant flavor. It also had shredded pork, which I'm not really accustomed to it having, but it was delicious. My husband liked his soup as well, though good  won-ton soup is much easier to find. I ordered the Cashew Chicken, which consists of chicken, cashews, water chestnuts, pea pods, mushrooms, and carrots. I liked the flavor of the Cashew Chicken, but it didn't really stand out for me compared to the same dish at other restaurants. My husband ordered the General Tsao Chicken and he was pretty pleased with what he had. They  also brought out a big plate of white rice for us to share from; the rice was cooked well and sticky.

The staff is great at making a person feel like scum of the earth for drinking coffee or juice because of the effects it has on teeth, even if the teeth are healthy.  You can relive getting lectured by your parents as they talk about the finer points of proper brushing from your vulnerable position strapped in a chair.  Few survive getting a filling but it is rumored that the experience is as pleasant as hearing fingernails on a chalkboard.  They are very talented in manhandling delicate gum tissue and patients are guaranteed a sore mouth for the rest of the day.  Customer service is second to none.  The office has evening appointments and if you are fortunate to schedule one you will be offered a once in a life time opportunity to come in earlier.  However if you are not able to get off of work and have to decline coming in early do not be surprised to get a call back from the receptionist informing you that your evening appointment is canceled because something unexpected has come up.

{"id": "fb3135594e49bc8046fd143df8e20070", "question": "No one really likes the dentist.  Especially since I've gotten older and my teeth have gone to hell no matter what I do.  (Yes, lady--I do floss.  Yes, lady--I brush at least twice a day, sometimes more.)  It's one of those things we hate because it's annoying, it takes time out of our schedules, and it's often painful.  No matter how we brush our teeth, we are prone to cavities.\\n\\nMidwest Dental isn't horrible.  I've had maybe five or six dentists in my life at this point, and I can probably say that of those that I've had, Midwest is the worst of them, but even still--they're not horrific.\\n\\nMidwest tends to assign you a hygienist so you see the same person every time you go. This is the first dental practice I've visited where this is the case. Every other one I went to, the hygienist was whomever was available.  \\n\\nMy first hygienist at Midwest was a young girl, fresh out of her two-year program, I believe.  She was nice enough, and competent, but she was a kid.  She liked kid things.  My first visit, while she had hands in my mouth and I couldn't scream at her that I didn't give two flying figs, she told me all about what had been going on during \\\"The Bachelorette\\\" that season.  The second time, she asked me what I was reading (I had a book with me), and then told me all about how much she loved \\\"Twilight.\\\" \\n\\nI was dreading a third uninformative visit with her, but she moved.  So, I was reassigned to a new hygienist.  Again:  A nice enough, competent hygienist, but not someone with whom I want to have a conversation. She still works there, so I won't go into too much detail in case she ever reads this.  She's a wonderful person, but I'm an introvert by nature. I don't want to make small talk.  I don't want to hear about her kids. I don't really tell people about my kids--why do I want to hear about yours, lady?\\n\\nThe hygienist is absolutely brutal with the dental floss.  She hammers that wax garrote up and down my teeth with all the subtlety of a teenage boy groping boobs for the first time.  \\n\\n\\\"Oh, your gums are bleeding.  You're not flossing enough.\\\"\\n\\nLady, I floss every friggin' day.  My gums don't bleed when I floss.  Maybe it's because you're trying to go THROUGH the frickin' tissue instead of along the tooth?  Don't even get me started on her skills with the violent metal pick.  She has cut me like Wolverine.\\n\\nThey also really like to indict you on anything you do food and drink-wise at this place.  \\\"Your teeth show wear.  Are you drinking soda?\\\"\\n\\nYeah, a can or two a day.  But I brush.\\n\\n\\\"YOU SHOULD NEVER DRINK SODA!  IN FACT, IF YOU LIVE IN A COUNTY WITH A SODA BOTTLING PLANT, YOU HAVE TO MOVE!  DON'T COME WITHIN TWO HUNDRED MILES OF A SODA!\\\"\\n\\nGeez, lady. Lighten up.  \\n\\n\\\"How much do you brush a day?\\\"\\n\\nAt least twice.  Once in the morning before I leave for work, and again at night.  Sometimes I sneak another one in there sometimes.\\n\\n\\\"How many minutes, though?\\\"\\n\\nTwo or three per session, plus flossing at night.\\n\\n\\\"YOU SHOULD BRUSH YOUR TEETH FOR THIRTY HOURS.  NEVER STOP BRUSHING.  YOU'RE NOT BRUSHING ENOUGH.\\\"\\n\\nWell hell, lady...\\n\\nThey also like to sell you extra crap that you may or may not need.  \\\"Here--here's a special paste you should rub on your gums.  It's $15.  Here's a special toothpaste. You can only get it here. It's $15.  If you need more, come back here and spend another $15.  Here's a rinse. It was made from elf urine. It's magic.  $22.\\\"\\n\\nIf my dental plan could be covered under another dentist that didn't involve a drive across Madison, I'd probably switch up and go there.  Unfortunately, I'm limited in my choices, so I'm stuck returning to Midwest Dental.\\n\\nAt least there's a Perkins right next door.  Right after I get my teeth done, I take a special pleasure in going into Perkins for a stack of flappys with extra syrup and a diet Coke.\\n\\n\\\"YOU SHOULD NEVER EAT SUGAR!

Afterwards I was impressed and absolutely full, but I wouldn't give it the BBQ crown.\\n\\nI think most of the value here comes from its uniqueness.  Smoky Jon's sits in a small little log-cabin-style shack, and when you walk in you are witness to the plethora of awards they have received from their delicious BBQ fixins.

{"id": "c96bd96eae895fde6787a0eab2b389df", "question": "I take my BBQ seriously and because of that I researched on-line via Yelp and other sites various reviews of BBQ places in Madison, finally deciding on Smoky Jon's No 1 B-B-Q.  Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.\\n\\nSo I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it.  Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The \\\"sugar-fried\\\" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.\\n\\nI strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.\\n\\nOh well...", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The text shows negative emotion as the reviewer had a series of negative experiences from a mix-up with the order to disappointment with the food quality, resulting in an overall unsatisfactory dining experience.

Adding to the d\\u00e9cor are the statewide accolades all around the walls. On this evening, the casual atmosphere happened to be unexpectedly subdued, quite unlike the other BBQ restaurants I've visited.   \\n\\nWe shared a Combination Meal ($17.75) that included our choice of 1/3 Slab, Smoked Pork Shoulder Sandwich, and extra serving of smoked pork shoulder, Cole Slaw, and BBQ Baked Beans. The Slab/Pork Ribs were smoky, tender, and the meat easily peeled off the bones. There was an excellent hint of smoke to deepen its flavor, and that was further enhanced by the BBQ sauce to provide a sweet higher note, strong black peppery secondary, and anchored by a noticeable spicy kick that reverberates with good hops. For the price, there wasn't enough meat on the ribs, but the flavors were still sensational. The dinner roll that this dish came with was sweet, soft, and spongy. I loved it.\\n\\nThe Pork Shoulder Sandwich was excellent as well. The pork shoulders were tender without one single dry spot--perfectly executed and delicious without the BBQ sauce. The meat was flavorful and deepened by its smoky flavor that coupled perfectly with the well-rounded, full-bodied spicy BBQ sauce. I absolutely loved it except for the buns that turned out flaky with hollow spots and lacking flavor. We finished the meat without getting into the buns very much. This sandwich could have been so much better with a bun of higher quality. \\n\\nThe BBQ Baked Beans were smooth, sweet, and delicious. The Slaw on the other hand was too wet with a weak texture. Compared to other BBQ joints, their sides could use more varieties such as green beans, collard greens, yam and other possibilities to complement this resounding BBQ.

In reading through all of the reviews, the one thing noticed is that the vast majority of positive reviews are unable to compare to bbq eaten in the known meccas of this country, while the negative reviews have many comparisons to KC, Texas, S Carolina, etc, etc.....  you know, the people that have been around and actually do KNOW what it is they are APPRECIATING.\\nKnowing that you HAVE won numerous awards in these very places, you would think that you wouldn't fall back on the review rating of those that don't know any better. No slam, I didn't know bbq from bratwurst until I started traveling either, but maybe it would be best to show WI what good bbq is, and not high-five yourself for being better than burgers and brats off the old Weber.... as my review stated, your place does have the potential to do that.\\nSo, while respecting your opinion as well, I still must disagree with you, and have offered all of the actual reasons for doing so. In the end, it's your business, run it how you will - just don't point at awards for sauces you don't offer, years of experience when it's not you at the pit, and a canned reply to those of us that know bbq stating we must not know how to appreciate it..... \\nAlso - my original review had everything in it regarding how to raise your food up to my, and many others, standards.

I also get that this IS Wisconsin, and bbq has a whole different meaning than in the bbq meccas around the nation, but damn....\\n\\nOrdered 1/2 rack w 1/2 chicken, 1/3 rack w pork shoulder sandwich, and 1/3 rack w brisket sandwich. Sides of baked beans, mashed potatoes, and mac-n-cheese. So, pretty good variety of what they offer. \\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- membrane not removed from ribs - trying to eat meat stuck to a huge piece of essentially dried and smoked skin as the bones are pulled apart is pretty gross. Any pitmaster or fan of bbq knows this needs to be removed prior to smoking, any other explanation boils down to plain laziness. Fully half of the meat was stuck to the membrane as it fell off the bones. And a star is lost!\\n- chicken was smoked beyond merely dry - think chicken jerkey. And a star is lost!\\n- both sandwiches were minced meat to the point of being indistinguishable from one another in both taste and appearance. Where are the slices of brisket and juicy chunks/shreds of pork? Not here. And a star is lost!\\n- only one bbq sauce is offered standard, the only other flavor (same sauce, only spicier) has to be ordered separately and at extra cost. Sides were very small (about 2oz) and nothing extraordinary - mac-n-cheese was somehow \\\"flour-ey\\\" with overcooked noodles. Can't imagine what end piece of corn with 5 kernels I would have received had I ordered that. And a star is lost!\\n\\nThe \\\"potential\\\":\\n\\nThe taste of the ribs was not bad, the chicken as well. I think if the \\\"pitmaster\\\" was given a raise and some training, or given the boot and replaced with someone qualified to run the pit, the food could be brought to par. I also think it's not to much to ask for a wider variety of sauces - where are the sauces that all of the newspaper clippings on the walls referencing Smoky Jon's contest awards at? Quit being cheap with the sides. I like taters, more than 5 bites please!! Hook up the mac with some cheese!!

I am  partially disabled and can have a difficult time walking, so when a store forces you to walk through needless extra aisles it becomes very daunting.\\nThis store seems \\\"artificially\\\" large and there is a TON of wasted space, it appears that they made the store as large as they legally could, and for no other reason than that.\\n\\nI also resent being distrusted to such a high degree. I fully understand that they must maintain a secure place, but Mernard's makes it super obvious. On the subject of distrust, I think they may distrust their employees even more than the customers. This is blatantly obvious when the cashiers have to get a manager's approval to accept a $20 bill or do any sort of pricing change in correcting one of their all to frequent \\\"computer goofs\\\"(funny how these \\\"innocent\\\" computer error/ pricing over-rings are ALWAYS in their favor).  They also boast a computer at the customer svc.counter displaying the Menard's website, but it doesn't go \\\"on-line\\\".  They offer a price guarantee but have no way to verify or look up a competitor's price due to this seemingly and prevailing level of distrust of everyone.\\n\\nI will give Monona Menard's props in just ONE area (Monona Menard's has an extra large wood shed and selection) and that is their lumber quality and selection. They have the most extensive assortment of awesome quality lumber I have ever seen in any lumber retailer anywhere. They have lumber assorted by species and size and it is not all culled and picked over, it is always nice, clean and straight. \\n\\nIf I have to ever return here it will be only for the lumber and building materials selection which is far superior to The HD or Lows.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The text shows negative emotion because it describes feelings of distrust towards the store's layout, treatment of customers, and handling of employees, ultimately expressing reluctance to return unless necessary, with the exception of acknowledging the quality of lumber as the only positive aspect."}

This Menards was recently remodeled and expanded. The yard area out back is much nicer and easier to get around than it used to be. The inside is huge, but arranged poorly. Now when you need to order stuff from the yard you have to go to the back corner farthest from the entrance. I get that they want you to wander through and maybe pick up random crap, but when all you need is bags on concrete it's annoying to have to make that trek. The new checkout lines are set up in a really dumb way. It forces the checkout person to have their back to you for most of the time that they are checking you out and you have to bag things yourself now.

I have never been to a supermarket that has its combination of size, local products and management.  It carries everything from value (Sentry Brands) to premium version of products.  \\n\\nThey also GIVE out free Sunday papers.  There is no low end of purchase to get this offer - I bought a pack of gum for under a dollar and they asked if I wanted a newspaper.  Righteous!\\n\\nEvery department runs extremely well.  I've never had a problem with rotten or outdated goods while shopping.  The staff are plentiful and friendly. Even at the busiest times, they staff cashiers smartly and the lines are rarely longer than three deep. \\n\\nDuring the late afternoon and early evening, you are bound to run into a vendor providing samples of their local product.  Unlike every other store I went to, it's often an owner or manager that handles the stand.  Frequently they even have WINE!  Delicious wine at that. \\n\\nLocal foods and brands are center stage here.  They are clearly identified as local on their display.  You'll see local everywhere from the bakery, frozen foods and cheeses (of course).\\n\\nThe only critique is that the deli prepared foods and the bakery are good, but not great.  If I have a little more disposable income, I go down the road to Whole Foods to get my prepared deli/bakery fix.

Park Copps -- I really deserve Metcalfe's!) or other like grocers. \\n\\nAlthough Whole Foods has a short list of better prepared products (for example, their deli and bakery), they cost so much more (it's referred to as \\\"Whole Paycheck\\\" for a reason) and have nowhere near the variety and local selection Metcalfe's has.\\n\\n\\nTips:  \\n\\n1 - Be careful in the parking lot.  Their are many patrons that have lost their driving skill (think that South Park episode) and it may be frightening at times.  Drive very defensively and always given certain drivers the right of way.\\n\\n2 - Like their Facebook page for insight on demos and events.  For example, last month they had a three-day cheese tasting event hosted by cheesemakers in town for the American Cheese Society Conference. \\n\\n3 - If you must use plastic bags, Metcalfe's has the best in the business - they are an awesome green (some sort of implied \\\"gentle\\\" dig, I know ... but whatever) and very sturdy.

Too bad we had already ordered cheese curds. \\n\\nBut, being the troopers we are, we ventured over to the salad bar and built a few plates. It was ok for a bar's salad, but not great by any means. My tomatoes were mushy and tasted \\\"off\\\"; broccoli was dry and obviously came from a bag. Coleslaw earned decent reviews.\\n\\nCurds and fish arrived at the same time. Curds were breaded and typical \\\"from the freezer bag\\\" variety. Nothing special, and not worth the $6.79 price tag.\\n\\nFish plates each had two pieces; baked cod was drenched in buttery water and loaded with dill flake. Hmm... It tasted ok, but wasn't as flaky, tender, or flavorful as I'd prefer. Baked potato was foil-wrapped, and nicely cooked.  \\n\\nBattered cod had a decent batter that had just a hint of a unique flavor (we couldn't put our finger on it, as it was tasty), but it was fairly greasy and like the baked cod, the actual fish was quite \\\"lifeless.\\\"  The cheesy hash browns were good- nice and crispy, with only a hint of grease.\\n\\nBattered lake perch was just like the cod, only it was more greasy. I shed a small tear as grease oozed out of the piece I tried.\\n\\nThe bill arrived... $55 for three with one round of beers.

Prior good reviews left me favorably disposed toward this salon; however, my experience was disappointing at best.  I will be routing about 300 women elsewhere. \\n\\nThe owner/manager (pretty adult woman) started the nailbed preparation, and selected/glued on the tips to start my manicure.  NO complaints here- she seemed personable, competent, and really seemed to take care to ensure that the correct curve/flatness of each nail bed was matched according to the actual nail- I was really happy.\\n\\nHowever, it seemed that a regular customer (likely for a more expensive service) came in, so the owner/manager had a girl come over to take over the rest of my service.   \\n\\nThe girl did not seem to be happy to do so, as she was on the phone (one of two phones she juggled during the ENTIRE service), trying to straighten out some issue with a purchase of jeans on line.  She was barely on autopilot as she commenced with my nail application. \\n\\nShe literally DID NOT EVEN LOOK at my nails as she buffed/grinded away at the nail beds- am convinced as to that's why the final angles are so weird on them (hard for me to see at the time, as I'd not had nails for a long time, and could not really give them a good look during the process)..  \\n\\nWhen she did speak to me- it was to order me around several times (get nail polish color, pay, go wash up, go dry) and was very abrupt with every command, even though I'm at least twice her age, a paying customer, not a subordinate.\\n\\nIt was NOT a case of second-language/cultural translation -this girl was acting like a petulant b-word, full stop - to a person who was sincerely being nice to her, and who just didn't remember all of the ropes (nor should I have had to do so!).\\n \\nShe literally left the salon for an extended period (upwards of 20 minutes)during the time that my nails were curing under the uV.  A nice man clicked the light on again for another cycle after the first curing, but the curing went on for FOUR light cycles before she deigned to return to the job. \\n\\nWhen she did, she ordered me to wash my hands.  I did go to the back of the shop, saw clean and soiled receptacles for nail scrub brushes, and figured out that I should likely used the clean brush, scrub up, and then place the used brush in the oher receptacle - all assumed because she didn't deign to actually tell me ANYTHING (was AGAIN heading out a doorway with her phone).\\n.  \\nThere was a hot towel available for use- she had slapped it down on the counter on her way out, and God knows what was on the counter (though the place did seem to be clean, and I did notice the man take special care to sterilize/clean a pedicure station after a client while I was there).\\n\\nI did end up using it, but had no place to put the used towel.

{"id": "0d79a7a4ed058c3bfeab1e0595c5a7fb", "question": "This is a difficult review to write.  For years, Corkscrew was my favorite haunt and I could be found there for wine tastings each Friday and Saturday, occasionally for Sunday beer tastings, and sometimes just to stop by on off nights and sample some wines.  It was like a home away from home.  There was an ever-increasing group of regulars that lingered after the formal tastings to open bottles of wine and share with one another and with newcomers.  I met so many nice people there.  People shared wine and conversation and food.  It was a feeling of camaraderie, of family, and it extended even to the staff.  Wine tastings were held in the back corner of the store and people milled about in that close little area, lending itself to conversations and introductions and socializing in general.  That was in the days before \\\"Buvons\\\" and all the other frills.  Things have changed.  I returned to Corkscrew recently after a six month absence.  I paid $20 for a platter of three pieces of cheese, a few slices of bread, and a few apricots that cost me a mere $8 last Fall.  I was also surprised to see a charge of $2 for a glass from which to drink my wine purchase: another new fee.  Glasses were always free.  Many of the staff from my \\\"era\\\" left and management has changed.  The new manager, Todd Fusco, is a knowledgeable and personable guy who previously managed another favorite place of mine, Farren's.   He has inherited the current concept there.  He will do well because he has the savvy and personality to succeed.  Corkscrew still has their impressive selection of fine wine, craft beer, and other spirits.  It still has its weekly tastings and many new events, but people take their glass of wine and wander about the larger expanses of \\\"Buvons\\\" without the interaction of the old days.  I would hope that its staff would be as knowledgeable as those who have left.  Live music has been added, not something I particularly enjoy in some settings, like when I'm trying to enjoy a nice glass of wine and good conversation.  I am not necessarily resistant to change and I did make an effort when some of these changes were initiated last summer, but in my opinion the intimacy, the camaraderie has lost something in the redesign and restructure of the place.  The new Corkscrew appears successful which is nice because the people behind Corkscrew are nice people and were always good to me in the past. It's great to hear that so many people attend events there.  For me, however, it's  just not the same.  I shall always miss the old days, the little perks, the gathering of people, and the sense of belonging.  I give a rating of three stars because it still is the best wine emporium in C-U but withhold two stars for the loss of something unique and personal that it once offered.  If you were a part of that, you would understand.\\n\\nOn second thought . . Meh, I've experienced better.  Sadly, the \\\"better\\\" I experienced was the old Corkscrew, before this \\\"Buvons\\\" nonsense started.  I've given the new concept several tries and always come away disappointed.  It has become a cold, impersonal business.  Corkscrew has lost its soul, its heart, its spirit.  I mourn its passing.\\n\\nUPDATE:  Recently went to a \\\"wine tasting.\\\"  What a joke. Those participating were denied entry into the hallowed halls of \\\"Buvons\\\" and consigned to a small area near the cash registers.  I was then told that they were phasing out their weekly tastings, once the hallmark of the place and a draw for those new to wine as well as connoisseurs.  Prominently placed on the entry to said \\\"Buvons\\\" was a large, hand-drawn sign asking for a $6 cover fee.  Our group was granted a table in those hallowed halls and some bought bottles of wine to share.  I was one.  They were charging a $5 corkage fee for each bottle.  WHAT?!?!?  A corkage fee by definition is charged by a restaurant to patrons bringing their own wines.  We were buying our wines there.  When did this nonsense start?  In discussing the policy with some former regulars, I was regaled with stories of apathy by staff when asked if Corkscrew could get certain wines (which Binney's did get) as well as other costly and ludicrous changes in policy.  A pleasant wine experience has taken a back seat to live music.  In the poor acoustics of \\\"Buvons\\\" the music is loud enough yet musicians still use amps.  Conversations are impossible once the music starts, as is any enjoyment of wine and the overpriced cheese plates.  One would think staff would wear masks as they rob you blind but they feel no such need to hide their identity.  This demise of a once customer friendly, intimate wine emporium was difficult to see.  I recall my concerns when the owners planned to expand.  I said I hoped it wouldn't alter the conviviality of the place and was assured things would be the same.  Not a chance.  I read the reviews here and am astonished.  Then again, it sounds like the reviewers never knew what Corkscrew was like before greed took over.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "Negative emotion is evident in the text as the author expresses disappointment and sadness over the changes in their favorite haunt, Corkscrew, which has lost its intimate and welcoming atmosphere, leading to a feeling of mourning its loss.

(Coincidentally, that's what I plan to do to the leftovers...)\\nI also got egg-drop soup, which was alright. However, I got some fried noodles with my soup, and was even further disappointed.

On one hand they have some unique academic programs and great professors, but you'll probably have to slog through lots sub-par classes before you get the good classes. \\n\\nBusiness is one of the \\\"better\\\" colleges, but you wouldn't know if from the lower level classes. My least favorite class ever was an upper level econ (econ is technically in LAS even though business people spend plenty of time in the department) class that was taught by a TA who not only didn't speak very good English, but who also gave really harsh tests. The first test average was a 64% and there was no curve. Grading is harsh here! Lots of people repeat classes. I also have plenty of bad things to say about accounting and finance classes, but it depends on the class I guess. \\n\\nLAS is the catch-all college that gets shafted a lot. Many of my lectures were too big and in auditoriums were literally falling apart. Contrast that with the much-funded engineering college's glittering shiny collection of brand new giant buildings. Oh well. \\n\\nACES, my college, is a bit of a catch-all college as well, but some of the majors are quite small. I've had my smallest and favorite classes in ACES. For development and other niche economics specialties this is the place to be and undergrads get lots of attention. It also has top-notch programs in other aggy stuff ranging from food science to animal science. I adore most of my professors I have had in this college. The only downside is that ACES has tended to attract some less than bright students in the past and has some programs within it in need of reform, but I'm sure that is true in many UIUC colleges.  I recommend ACES, but only if you are truly interested in the curricula. \\n\\nI would note that I skipped all gen-eds and a lot of ugly giant lower level classes thanks to APs and placements tests. If you can do that, it is worth it, because the upper level classes are where you can really enjoy academics. The lower level classes seem to be purposefully soul-crushing, with harsh curves, unintelligible TAs, and professors who just read off powerpoints. 101 classes are where learning goes to die. I basically did well on them by memorizing lectures off flashcards, a sad way to \\\"learn\\\" if you ask me. Don't be afraid to switch classes if you get a bad feeling on the first day. I did that a lot and it was worth it for the English-speaking TAs. \\n\\nI am personally not a fan of the Greek system, which welds a little too much power here. The drunken anti-intellectual environment can be stifling if you don't find a niche. Allen Hall is the place to be for anti-Greeks/hippies/outsiders and it has the bonus of small lower level classes often taught by people who actually care. Avoid the isolated residence halls like PAR and FAR, go six-pack only if you are Greek-ish, and ISR is the place to be for engineers and other assorted people who want to live near the science and engineering buildings. Dorm food is a mixed bag...it's mostly just inexcusably bad, but most people don't seem to notice because they think fries and hot dogs= acceptable lunch. \\n\\nI like the Chambana area, even if it has some minor annoyances. Ill-kept frat houses and a bizarre lack of on-campus grocery stores mar it, but otherwise it was easy for me to find restaurants to eat at and assorted drunk-free places to hang out. However, I can think of about ten major cities where I'd rather live.\\n\\nThe weather here is horrible.

We were craving pho, and normally we go to Cravings for that but he had come here with his boss and swore it was better here. Noting the couple in front of us eating the beef version of pho I got excited. We ordered the seafood pho.\\n\\nWhen it came I noticed there was something immediately wrong: the noodles looked suspiciously like Top Ramen egg noodles instead of rice noodles but I dug in cos I was so hungry. My boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different. It also had no garnish (bean sprouts, basil), no lime, and there was no oil that normally comes in the soup. \\n\\nWhen we inquired the lack of garnish or lime, we were informed by a very nervous waitress that our pho was \\\"special\\\". We then asked for srirarcha (sp?) and got a tiny dollop of it. All in all we paid $16 for beef Top Ramen with seafood floating in it. It was very salty and unpleasant. I felt disgusted that I actually ate half since I was so hungry.\\n\\nMultiple theories as to why we were treated this way. The couple in front of us had the beef pho and it had the garnish and the lime/oil and rice noodles.\\n\\n1) We didn't look Asian enough: I'm Filipino Italian (look at my profile picture) and my boy is Filipino but could pass for Latino sometimes. They were too cheap to serve us the real thing or thought they could get away with serving us the ramen since we \\\"didn't know any better anyway\\\".\\n\\n2) They were out of ingredients and were too lazy to bother telling us  and offer alternatives or a refund.\\n\\n3) A combination of number 1 and 2.\\n\\nI guess it serves us right for going into a Chinese restaurant for pho but Cravings serves multiple Asian dishes as well and they got it right. What made us the most angry is the fact that the Asian couple in front of us got exactly what they wanted and we left unsatisfied. My boy swears he got good soup there but his boss is more Asian looking and could be the reason why they got it right.

He is very down to earth, understanding, knowledgeable, and comforting. I would highly recommend him as a primary care provider. I have also seen a few nurse practioners here in other departments that I have liked. Unfortunately, my biggest problem is with billing. What I have learned by working in the health field is that most people do not understand billing and health insurance and therefore often times get overcharged. I have only been to Christie Clinic a few times, but I seem to have a billing issue every time I go.  My first appointment I had was a preventative annual physical which should be billed as such in order to have the appointment paid at 100%. There also should not be a co-pay for preventative physicals according to my insurance. However, instead of billing it as an annual physical, Christie Clinic seems to only bill as medical office visits. There is a big difference between the two especially when it comes to payment. I have tried to call to resolve this problem, and all they told me is  \\\"you probably said something during the visit that made it an office visit instead of a physical.\\\" Something I said? Really? Even the labs that the doctor ordered for me were labeled as \\\"preventative screening.\\\" Even when the doctor entered the room, he said \\\"You're here for an annual physical right?\\\" Yet, apparently I \\\"must have\\\" said the wrong thing during that visit. \\n\\nThe other separate issue I had is I went in for an annual pap smear last year. Which was also supposed to be paid 100% because it is preventative screening. Well first of all, the doctor billed the reading of the specimen on a separate day from the actual visit. Therefore, (according to my insurance) it looked as if I made two visits in the same week and therefore my insurance only paid for the first date that they used for billing. If they were billed on the same day like they should have been, I would not have had a bill. \\n\\nOn another visit, I had some lab work that came back abnormal. I did not get a phone call, a letter, or any type of response from the clinic, letting me know of my abnormal results. I did not call them myself because they told me that I would not hear back from them unless there was a problem. Therefore, I thought everything was fine. Not only did I not know of a problem in the first place, but they decided to do further testing without even notifying me first. They did further testing on the specimen without my consent. The only way I found out about this further testing and initial abnormal result is from the bill I received 9 months later. Yes, 9 months later. When trying to discuss the bill, they told me that the bill was final and there was nothing that they could do.\\n\\nNot to mention, if you ever ask for paperwork with the diagnosis codes on them, a good majority of the time Christie Clinic uses diagnosis codes for what they are trying to rule out. For example, when trying to rule out multiple sclerosis, they actually DIAGNOSE you with multiple sclerosis even when it has not been confirmed by testing. That's a pretty serious diagnosis if you ask me. I have seen it done with other things too such as myasthenia gravis, pneumonia, seizures, etc. Good thing insurances are not allowed to deny you coverage based on pre-existing conditions anymore...", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The text expresses negative emotion as it highlights multiple instances of billing errors, lack of communication regarding abnormal results, unauthorized further testing, and using incorrect diagnosis codes, leading to frustration and inconvenience for the author.

Everything in the restaurant was sticky from the menu to table to the floor. Usually that may mean good traditional food. Unfortunately this was not the case. I ordered a carne asada and enjoyed my mexican coke eating complimentary chips with salsa. The chips are straight from a bag and the salsa was quite bland. I was hungry so I enjoyed my chips still and ate the whole basket. When my carne asada came it was not what I expected. The meat was hidden in a pile of chopped up onion, peppers, and large chunks of green onion stems. Why would you put giant pieces of green onion in with the carne asada. These were not pleasant and bitter tasting. The carne asada is usually very tender the way it was prepared. This was again not the case. Very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy. The problem is that it was thinly sliced so it was quite over cooked. The refried beans was a soupy mess, but the mexican rice was passable. All and all this does not come even close to maize in the term of quality and flavor. Did I mention that there was so much oil in the dish...

There is no large menu on the wall, but rather a menu at the table where you order which is sort of annoying as you can hold up the line if you are waiting to order or the menu along the wall.

This is where it falls short. The fries that come with the combo is a very small portion. I can't imagine that it is just a small helping of fries on a little serving basket. Usually that is a highlight when you go to gyro restaurants because it adds to the grease appeal. Additionally, they are quite stingy with the meat, i.e. they actually weigh and measure how much gyro meat you are getting. I have never been to one where you can get 4 different sizes of gyro meat.

None of them, even for the ones provide no service at all, had left me with such a horrific memory.  I had made a reservation at 8p.m. to celebrate the night with my family and friends who came all the way to this seemingly middle of nowhere.

As a recent grad expecting an exciting and enjoyable dinner, I started to fume up with anger.  Then finally after another 15 minutes, we were being seated.  However, this nightmare did not end then.  We were sitting there for yet another 20 minutes to be finally served with water (and that's after we asked for it).

I will speak of my last visit because it's fresh in my mind!\\n\\nIt was Monday night, 10/03/2011 around 6:45pm. I stood at the door for the better part of 10 minutes before I grabbed my own menu and finally seated myself.

My goat cheese came out about 5 minutes after ordering. Looked great...but she forgot my bread. When I got her attention and asked her for the bread that is suppose to be served with the goat cheese, she told me they didn't have any fresh bread ready, but there was some in the oven. Needless to say, 10 minutes had passed before my bread came out! Now my goat cheese was cooled and not easily spreadable! \\n\\nFrom that point, I waited for an additional 15 minutes before my meal came out. It looked great! The seasoned fries that came with the fillet were pretty good. As I sliced into my fillet, a pool of blood came gushing out!!! I cut the fillet in half, down the middle and spread it apart. It was so red and bloody, it almost looked purple! The center of the fillet was cool to the touch! \\n\\nI immediately got the attention of the frazzled server and brought it to her attention. She apologized and took the steak back to the kitchen to be put back on the grill. I sat and waited another 15 minutes before I saw my fillet again. It was the same piece of meat brought back out with fresh garnishments. I parted the fillet once again, only to find my steak was just as bloody and bright red as the first time! Now I'm livid! It was once again, cool to the touch! Keep in mind, I'm paying almost $30 for this dinner, without appetizer or drink. \\n\\nI brought the server back over and asked her if she thought my fillet was cooked medium...she hung her head in shame, apologized once again, and agreed with me that the fillet sitting in front of me was nowhere near medium. She pulled the plate back and was going to take it back to the kitchen when I stopped her and told her to box it up, and I will take it home and cook it myself! I gave Luna 2 different opportunities and around 90 minutes of my time, only to be disappointed again! I boxed up my fillet, paid my bill, and left the restaurant mad, once again! The only thing she did to compensate me for my experience was, a free drink. Meanwhile, I paid a $42 bill, for a horrible dinner, for myself! \\n\\nThe service sucks, their attitude is horrible and the food is so overpriced! If the owner would call me today and offer me a free meal, I would hang up on her! I'm never going back! I've wasted enough time and money in that place!

For $11 + tip + tax, it had enough varieties.  Some really good, some right on mediocrity, which is very common with buffet. Their butter chicken and tandoori roast chicken are worth trying.  Saag paneer is phenomenal for those interested in vegetarian options.  Lunch buffet had probably the best naan I've tried in many years.

{"id": "9fe2265f50649dcd421d41df7fddeae2", "question": "I worked here for a few months (August until two days ago).  I was fired on a very contrived reason - I think it was because this place doesn't get enough business.\\n\\nLocation is pretty bad for visibility, even if it's convenient to campus.  Food is very average, but I like it more than, say Panda Express.  My parents run a restaurant so I have experience (which is why I was hired in the first place) - this is one of the most inefficiently-run restaurants ever.  The vegetable dishes are good, though, and the Chinese-language menu is generally good quality if you don't mind a wait.  The bosses both cook when necessary, but it's best to come during weekdays, when the main cook is in.  The hot pot is also fairly popular, but most of the meats are frozen.  Other things that are frozen include the \\\"Wheaten Foods\\\" menu (potstickers, wontons, and meat buns).  I think that's pretty SOP here in CU, though.\\n\\nPortion sizes are okay.  They definitely shrank in the 3 months I worked there.  I won't analyze pricing, because I'm not used to eating out, but I think most people consider them fair or just slightly overpriced.\\n\\nThings to not get include the highly-Americanized items on the menu, especially those with breaded chicken in them.  The quick lunch was phased out mostly - now it's a selection of two Chinese braised dishes, so they keep pretty well (and have an average turnover).  Instead, they now offer \\\"Combos,\\\" which are your standard rice and a main dish, with an egg roll.  They used to give a soda with these, but now only offer iced tea, hot tea, or a small bowl of egg drop or hot and sour soup.  Don't get the soups (including noodle soups) or appetizers unless you really like egg rolls (they're decent but nothing special).  Certain dishes like the pork with mustard greens (P10, IIRC) are frozen, but I think they're probably okay if you don't mind them defrosting/reheating via microwave.  The smoothies and bubble tea are a no-no - they're edible and not too terrible, or so I hear, but go to Evo's or some other place for these; the slushies are okay if you don't mind a lot of sugar.  Most customers seem okay with the fish, but it doesn't look too great to me (aka it smells, and fresh fish doesn't).  To qualify that last statement, it doesn't reek like rotten fish, but you can definitely get a stronger smell than I think is usual when you gut one (I bass fish at home and clean my own catch) - plus, while it's inevitable, it's frozen and quick-defrosted (aka in the sink, in a water bath with direct contact, rather than through a bag).  Hardly sanitary).\\n\\nLike some other reviews have stated, they really do skimp as much as possible on ingredients, equipment, etc.  Ingredients come in on Thursday nights from Far East, and I'm not sure when other ingredients come in.  However, I'd say to come on Friday, because they probably push the old vegetables on Thursday (I only worked TR lunch and Sundays, so I can't say for certain).\\n\\nA few big points about the owners' behavior (which they also try to instill in the workers): first, they will try to dissuade you from getting something that they feel is too much trouble to cook at the moment, never mind if they have all the ingredients ready (usually this is because it's busy); secondly, they do cut corners, as aforementioned.  Another thing that most people probably aren't too concerned about because they aren't very aware of it, is the matter of the \\\"special soup.\\\"  They only give it to regular customers, but more generally to any Chinese or Chinese-speaking customers.  If you're not Chinese/speaking-proficiency or a repeat customer who asks, tough luck (I've seen this attitude referred to on foodie blogs as \\\"soup Nazism\\\").  A last point on their behavior is that they will lie about what they have and don't have, especially when it comes to drinks or if they feel they're too busy to bother with your order.  Normally this happens with drinks (they keep changing their Combo meals, and they decided to stop giving sodas with them because they didn't want to stock up); they will also refuse to make you a smoothie or other blended drink if they're busy.\\n\\nBasically, they have an undersized facility, an undertrained staff (one of the bosses in particular gets in the way more than he keeps things going), an undersized staff, and basically a very mediocre business model.  I'm kind of astounded they've survived, but if you know what to get, you can get a pretty decent meal here.\\n\\nTo conclude, there aren't a lot of repeat customers, but they try to treat the ones they recognize well.  However, I went to Cravings with a friend yesterday, and I saw a lot of former customers that stopped coming there.  I'd say they made a good choice (Cravings has much better service, food, and atmosphere).  Other good Chinese restaurants in the area, in no particular order, include Mandarin and Lai-Lai.

It was a Saturday night and we got there at around 10 p.m.  We noticed that they are about to close and asked if they can still take us in.  They said that they can take us and we told them that we have one more friend coming.  So they sat us down and another girl came up and told us that the sushi bar already close for the night and they suppose to close in 2 minutes.  She hurried us to order from the menu and told us that the kitchen might not take anymore order if our friend did not get there in 2 minutes. (And I am not exaggerating, that was what she told us.)  I was really hungry and decided to order yakitori with yakisoba and it came with a salad and fried rice.  The food was horrible.  There was 3 sticks of skewered chicken which they tried to pass as yakitori  and cost almost $8 and the fried rice looked so horrible that I did not even touch it.  My yakisoba tasted worse than a 100 yen instant soba that I could have bought at any convenient store in Japan.  And the service was the worst thing at this place.

This is the type of place where the wait staff will judge you by your potential to tip, and then ignore you if you obviously fall into the category of \\\"poor college student.\\\"  If you come here, regardless of your background, at least dress like you own money so that you'll get your drinks refilled. \\n\\nOn a particularly busy weekend night, I showed up with a friend and expected to wait for for a table.

When I got home, I tried to purge my mouth with Listerine.  Even with it's advertised \\\"deep-cleaning action,\\\" I couldn't get the taste of putrid fish out of my mouth.

Stick to the cooked dishes at Kamakura: tempura, teriyaki, udon, etc.\\n\\nWith so many better sushi restaurants in the area, I don't see how Kamakura hangs onto customers.
