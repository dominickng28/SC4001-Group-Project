After they put the car up on the lift and inspected it, they told us that we needed all new struts (front and rear), a new wheel, alignment, and balancing.  I think the estimate was about $1000 for all that.  Then I asked why they recommended replacing the front struts if the problem that caused the wheel to wear was in the back.  The explanation I got was that the front struts didn't *need* to be replaced, but they recommended it because of the struts' age.  That brought the total down to around $500.\\n\\nSo then I'm scratching my head wondering how the struts in the rear can be bad, because there's no noise or softness or weird bounce in the rear suspension (or the front, for that matter).  My gut told me to get a second opinion.\\n\\nSo we took the car out east to my wife's regular family mechanic.

{"id": "49df278366c8da99cb3a9ade64a9bb2a", "question": "As I was out running some errands, I noticed the banner hanging from the local Pizza Hut advertising their lunch buffet and I decided to stop.  I recall seeing somewhere that they were only putting personal pizzas on the buffet these days, but that isn't the case, at least at this location.  They are full-fledged pies.  Pizza Hut pies, to be sure, but they are the real ones, not the baby-sized ones.  That can actually be both good and bad.\\n\\nIt's good because you can get a decent slice from the buffet.  It can be bad because with room for only four pizzas at a time, and with one of those at any given time being a dessert pizza, it means if one of the three main pizzas isn't one that you like, you may have to wait for one that you like.  This is an issue because the restaurant isn't very busy - probably the reason for the banner outside.  As such, the three pizzas don't go very fast.\\n\\nStill, if you're at Pizza Hut, chances are that you like their pizza at least okay.  It's not like you're out on a limb to try something adventurous.  If you want more variety, go to CiCi's Pizza.  If you want something good, try Big Guy's Pizza instead.\\n\\nAnyway, the pizza isn't bad.  You just don't get a lot of choices.  They also have pasta, but in my experience, it's usually almost gone.  I don't know if this is because people don't like the choices of pizza and eat all the pasta, because they don't put much out, or some combination of both.  There are also bread sticks, but they don't usually have many of those either.  There is a good bit of marinara sauce, but I'm not sure what you're supposed to use it on, since the pizza has plenty and there is usually little pasta or bread.  You can also get a salad, but it costs extra.\\n\\nThe service is generally friendly, but not very good.  The price is a bit much.  For all this and a drink you'll pay more than you should.  The one bright spot is the sweet tea.  It is sweet and syrupy, just like it should be.

Since I am a small business owner and work in customer service, I know the impact of word of mouth. Let me just say Meineke gave me the worst service I've received in my year and a half since moving to NC. First visit, a mechanic talked me out of getting my brakes repaired after I came in expressing concern about a grinding deeling I experience when I back up. Nothing is wrong, its just the brakes adjusting after it rains he said. Your brake pads & shoes have 40% left he said. A month later I was at Lexus getting my shoes AND rotors replaced. AND was told the front had 5% wear left... and like an idiot, I returned fir my last free oil change (2 free preferred oil changes from Groupon). From the beginning I should've turned around. I came in expressing I ONLY want my preferred oil change because they dropped the ball on the brakes. After explaining the last situation, there was no offer to rectify the matter in any way. A mechanic doing the oil change brought me to the back to show me my front brakes like I didn't just tell him what he was telling me. Then told me I need an air filter. Smh. Simple quick fix. I tell him to add it. Can't mess that up right? Wrong. It took an extra 35 mins to add the add filter. Then I get my bill and see they've only done a BASIC oil change. No topping of fluids, no rotating of my tires... so I ask what oil change did you do? The mechanic says Basic. And I asked, what does the Groupon say? He says Preferred. And I said, my car requires a synthetic blend. And what happened to my tired rotation? The mechanic said oh we rotated the tires too; I watched him do it. Everything that should've been done is handled miss. I go outside, and the same chalk marking that was there on my left rear tire, is still there, on the left rear. Smh. I was already late for my next appointment and beyond sick of this ordeal so I left. And the ENTIRE time this disaster is happening, the store manager is periodically coming out to greet everyone who comes in EXCEPT me. He hears my complaint, and NEVER comes out to at least apologize for any inconvenience. I just pray their basic oil change doesn't harm my engine. I will never in life return to nor will I recommend Meineke as a company to trust your car with!", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment of the review is negative due to multiple instances of poor customer service and incompetence experienced by the reviewer at Meineke.

The lack of accountability, failure to correct mistakes, and overall unsatisfactory experience described in the review contribute to the negative sentiment expressed towards Meineke."}

The first one went great- they did an overall inspection and told me about a few things on my car that would need some attention in the future (included on a written report). He did try to get me to get a couple additional services for an astronomical price, but I passed. \\nToday, I went in for my appointment for my second oil change & tire rotation. I also opted to have my power steering fluid flushed as they had previously recommended- which cost $60. After 1 hour, they told me my car was ready-awesome!

Got in my car and checked the menu. They hadn't reset my oil percentage like they did last time (no big deal though) but my tire PSI values were all reading the same (I went in with one low tire and I was aware which one it was). I walked back in and asked the guy if my tires had been rotated. He grabbed my receipt and highlighted where it said \\\"Tire Rotation\\\". I can read, thanks. I kindly told him that my tire pressures were the same as when I walked in and the low tire was in the same location. He said he would check with his technician. Comes back a minute later and asks for my keys. No, they did not rotate the tires even though it stated they did on my receipt. They said sorry, rotated the tires, but didn't even put any air in the one that was low. If they were too busy to do their job right, they should have rescheduled some appointments. My issue is that since they lied once, I really have no idea if they did the oil change & fluid flush correctly (or at all for that matter). It also wouldn't have been that big of an issue if the guy at the counter wasn't so cocky highlighting my receipt and instead check with his technician first.

{"id": "514c1c8333b5c726bf927ff8af162e69", "question": "Beer aficionados rejoice!\\n\\nIf you're like me, you're sick and tired of going out for dinner and having 3-5 draft beers to choose from. I'm thrilled if I can pull a beer not slapped with a \\\"Lite\\\" label; or when I ask for a stout the waitress has something other than Guinness to provide. I crave diversity of lagers and ales like a foodie craves weirdly named cheeses. I'm pretty sure, in fact, that the Saucer was created for people exactly like me.\\n\\nWalking into the door I instantly get the same feeling of the hole-in-the-wall pubs I frequented back in college - just much larger. And cleaner! Almost every surface not walkable in the building is covered in decorative dishes so dense that your grandma's cabinet just shed a tear. It's cluttered but not oppressive, and again, it always feels clean and comfortable. There's a couched section up front for those really lazy days; elevated booths on the wall for small parties; and a lot of tables for any size group you can organize. And then there's the bar...\\n\\nBellying up to the bar at the Saucer is easy - it's roughly 50 feet long. From this bastion of beervana, you can see the real reason you came here - the jaw-dropping wall of tap heads and stuffed bottle coolers. It's a selection so big that trying to pick by looking is almost a fool's errand - you could easily down a pint just while trying to weigh the options. Thankfully, they have a well-organized (and four-page dense) beer menu that will help you find just the draft or bottle you're looking for. I want to give some kind of feeling for what you'll find here, but the simple answer is - everything. I've had everything from double IPAs aged in oak barrels to blueberry wheat beer to a savory coffee milk stout. Any style you could ever want, well, it's here. It's impressive. It's a little terrifying. It's very, very delicious. There are $3 fire sale specials every night of the week as well. Saturday's \\\"Beer Poker\\\" is my favorite - a random bottle from their cooler for three bucks. I've scored a few Victory and Rogue bottles there, so it is definitely not just the leftovers. \\n\\nAs for the food, well... It's decent. Let's be fair, I'm not coming here for their burgers. Food at the saucer is a means to an end; the food is here so you can cleanse your pallet between brews. That being said, there are a few musts on the menu. For a snack, you cannot beat the soft pretzels. You get two, they're huge, warm, salty and soft - if you're on a date and you don't get this, don't expect a second date. The brats are decent, the burgers have flavor, and oh yeah - spicy cheesy pepper tater tots. You'll find something. \\n\\nI guess the last thing worth mentioning is the service. A place with this diverse a beer selection could rest on its laurels, but the Saucer follows through with an excellent staff. Beyond the fact that your waitresses are gorgeous smiling Beer Goddesses wearing short short skirts and knee-hi stockings... They're genuinely nice and know what they've got on the menu. Talking with them is talking with peers. They check in on the table frequently and always have a good recommendation on what beer is next. A few of them pay attention enough to recognize me and remember what I had on the last visit. Coming to the saucer is like hanging out with friends.\\n\\nOne last word of advice - if you're serious about your beer exploration, sign up for the UFO club. For $18 you get a commemorative t-shirt and a membership which clears you from (very infrequent) cover charges and lets you track the beers you have on each visit. Drink 200 different beers and you get your name in the ring of honor, a commemorative plate on the wall, and a $100 tab for a party for you and your friends. There's a reward every 50 - I just earned a free pint - and you get the benefit of trying a ridiculously wide selection of beers and learning more about what the craft has to offer. You will find new favorites and probably a few that you can't stand. But that's the point of the journey, now, isn't it?\\n\\nSo bottoms up, there's a lot to drink.

I guess so.\\n\\nInside, the woman working at the counter was nice... She had me completely finished in about 10 minutes and I headed out to the car... It was a 2013 White Dodge Dart...

I heard a weird ping sound while I was driving a few minutes in, but it was directly behind me, so I figured I would just check it out when I got home since we live pretty close to the airport...

Once I got to the front of the bay, I noticed a small sign that didn't even reach past the height of the hood of the car it was in front of ...

Even with a wedge in your hand, you are looking to land the ball short of the putting surface if you want to wind up putting.\\n\\nIt is also one of the most dangerous courses I've played. I've never heard \\\"fore!\\\" yelled so much on a course before. A lot of the holes run parallel to each other, and tee-boxes are perilously close to greens on some holes. It's definitely a place you want to stay on your toes, and maybe even throw a hard hat in your golf bag.\\n\\nAll that being said, one of my best moments on a golf course occurred at Sunset Hills earlier this summer. \\nMy friend Dave and I were out there one Wednesday afternoon, trying to get in a late 18. It was crowded, and we were waiting on the 2nd tee box when the twosome playing behind us asked if they could join us. \\n\\nWe said yes, and as they introduced themselves, I found myself looking up at James Worthy, all 6'7\\\" of him. UNC star and '82 Final Four MVP James Worthy, 3-time NBA Champion and former Laker James Worthy, recently voted one of the top 50 NBA players of all time. I almost fell down.\\n\\nWorthy just happened to be in town to support of an upcoming golf tournament benefitting the Boys & Girls Club of Gastonia, his hometown, and his friend dragged him over to Sunset for a few holes.\\n\\nThey only stayed for the front nine, but we had a good time chatting it up between holes. Perhaps most importantly, he was a personable and gracious guy, which is what you hope for out of all your sports heroes.\\n\\nAs Carolina basketball fans, it was a great moment for Dave and I.

Normally, not an issue, especially since she gave them my phone number and instructions to leave the flowers with my apartment office if I wasn't at home.

On Tuesday, I called the number from her confirmation email and spoke to an unpleasant \\\"customer service\\\" representative.  She was rude and unhelpful, demanded if I had a confirmation number (which I did), and when I asked whether they would be left at my apartment office if I wasn't home, her response was \\\"That's what it says.\\\"  Finally, I returned home on Tuesday to find the flowers sitting on the ground by my door, not at the apartment office...

It wasn't. In fact, to say I was underwhelmed is an understatement. Where to start? We had a reservation for 8 and they even called us to confirm. But when we showed up, they made us wait for 15 minutes and there was nowhere TO wait because the bar was full of other diners in the same position. Waiting for their tables to turn. Pacing wasn't much better after we were seated as we watched our waiter do a series of odd jobs other than wait on tables (never mind ours) for 20 minutes. We only had water and menus. The menu isn't so long that it takes 20 minutes to make a choice. When we finally ordered, the food came quickly, but that was my next disappointment. My shrimp dumplings were only OK, and frankly tasted previously frozen. The halibut main course was a nice but TINY piece if fish, and the sauce flavors were almost too subtle. If I'm going to pay $29 for an entree, I expect more than six or seven bites of food! The highlight of the meal actually was dessert. We had a lemon marscapone cake with blueberry frozen yogurt and candied almonds which was superb! The flavors blended perfectly and the cake was light and moist. \\n\\nOther than the food lacking that \\\"fine dining\\\" perfection I would have expected, the space itself is awful.

It felt more like a chain restaurant's ambiance than a place you go for a special occasion that's for sure! \\n\\nOn the whole, a major disappointment. Maybe the economy has them packing people at the bar to up drink sales ( and overbooking to do it), maybe we hit an off-night,  I don't know, but I wouldn't go back. I should have gone back to Ratcliffe on the Green instead. That is a fine-dining experience. Barringtons was not.\\n\\nADDENDUM: I just re-read other reviews and wonder if I even ate at the same restaurant (yes, I know it WAS Barringtons, don't worry, I'm being sarcastic)! There was no four course option where we would get selections chosen by the chef, the chef never made an appearance, it was not quiet and intimate, it was loud, stuffy and decidedly \\\"suburban,\\\" and the fact that people don't seem to mind dropping $150 for salad and pasta, or appetizer and tiny entree is astounding to me when there are such amazing meals to be had in Charlotte for the same or LESS!", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment of the review is negative because the customer had high expectations based on rave reviews but was ultimately disappointed with their experience at Barringtons.

I confronted her about her lack of attention and being disrespectful. She stated it was busy and that other people needed her attention too we weren't the only people there. There were 6 people total sitting at the bar including our party. Even then she continued to have her conversation with the manager about (Facebook, instagram ect.)

After about ten min of conversation and the bartender speaking to us like we were animals I asked to speak to the manager. The bartender refused to close out my friends tab until either her co worker came back or we paid for her drinks. The manager never came, the bartender continued to be excessively rude. Slamming things around ect. Finally after being stuck in your establishment against our will for 45 min with the manager no where in sight.. the employee who left her tab open arrived. On the way back from using the filthy restroom, with a hole in the wall where there used to be a urinal and the sink that looked like a crew of diesel mechanics came through, I saw the manager on my way back to the front of the restaurant. I stopped and asked her if she was the manager. She was in the process of asking the cook to make her food stating. \\\"You know I'm a good person ill pay you back.\\\" Also at this point the employee who had left is now standing there and so is the bartender.

At that point I had informed the manager that I had been recording this circus act unfolding in front of me. Her response was \\\"awesome\\\". As she sputtered making no sense something about the bartender and it being her friend, she proceeded to tell me \\\"I didn't have time for this or you right now, I appreciate that so go back and watch your video\\\".

You couldn't see the table there was so much food. My # 1 pet Peeve at a restaurant when they cannot time the food properly enough to give you time to enjoy the food. I was pissed!  Chinese food doesn't take that long to cook and it was like a race for us to spend our money and get the heck out of there.  So, I and the rest of my party scarfed down our food and before I knew it while the pit was forming in my pre Christmas Day stomach the check was handed to us and we were basically being shown the door so they could get the next party in.\\n\\nI told the Manager about the experience and he explained that it was because of the \\\"circumstances of the evening\\\".  It was 4:00 and they were not busy at the time and I, being a long term customer don't appreciate being hurried when there was no reason to do so, except for the fact that you can't manage your kitchen.  If you can't handle it, don't open the effin restaurant.  \\n\\nWan Fu better open their eyes up to the reality that there are other options out there and you don't get repeat business, especially from long term customers by providing them crappy service.

I was very surprised to find out that my dish was actually really good. The flavors from the olives, the dressing that was put on it, and the seafood blended in really well. My husband ordered the filet minon medium rare, mashed potatoes, and zucchini medley. The filet minon was cooked medium with a very poor attempt of a holiendase sauce on top of the steak, it was tough to cut through, and the zucchini was not cooked all the way through. My husband was very dissapointed in the steak and regretted eating it.\\n\\nDessert was a joke. I ordered cr\\u00e8me brulee and my husband had their almond basket with ice cream. My dessert was not cooked all the way through and the strawberries that was served with it were very sour. It also came with banana bread muffins, but I was so fed up with my meal at that point I didn't bother with them. My husband had a little better luck with his than I did. The ice cream and sauce on the bottom of the dessert were alright, but the \\\"basket\\\" had sesame seeds on it and it completely threw off the taste. \\n\\nWe get our bill and come to find out it's $81.

We bring this up to our waiter (which that was the fastest he moved the whole night) and he told us there was nothing he could do and shrugged it off.

From my memory, it is still decorated pretty much the same based on the low benches at the pizza bar that are teal.  But that's fine - as long as the seats are comfy, I don't care what color they are.  I was greeted by a friendly hostess and seated at a comfy booth. Most of the other diners were 50+, again, nothing wrong with that, but on a Monday evening, it was an older crowd.  My waitress was friendly enough but I was waiting on her quite a bit.  I was afraid to drink all of my water, as I didn't think I would be getting a refill.  I was not a fan of the service, I was in there for over an hour and all I ordered was a sandwich and a piece of pie.  But slowness isn't the worst of the waitress traits (I will get to that...)\\n\\nThe food:\\nRoasted Beef Tenderloin sandwich with fries ($10) - (pictured) The first bite was delicious with a bite of soft bread, grilled onions, crispy onions, pepper jack cheese, herbed mayo and tender, well-flavored beef.  The second bite was stringy steak.  The third bite the meat was a little tougher.  Overall it wasn't a bad sandwich at all.  Pretty well balanced, although maybe a little spicier than I would have liked for a tenderloin sandwich.  The fries were fine, standard fries, nothing special, and served with a tiny cup of ketchup that was enough for exactly half of the fries.  Had I seen my waitress before I was almost done eating, I would have asked for more.  3/5\\nChocolate Silk Pie ($4) - The description said it was a creamy white and dark chocolate mousse on Oreo cookie crust.  Drizzled with chocolate and I think raspberry sauce, along with some fresh strawberry slices scattered about, it was mostly frozen.  It reminded me of a Carvel ice cream cake.  It wasn't bad, well-presented, but wasn't what I was expecting. 2.5/5\\n\\nNothing was bad, but nothing was spectacular, however everything seemed to be reasonably priced and included crab cakes and scallops, which my mother loves, so I would have made a return trip toting her along.

I have a mouth like a sailor, and I am pretty hard to offend, but her \\\"joke\\\" turned my stomach.  And this was not a teenager, this was a girl who was easily in her mid to late 20's and should have more class and better home training than to repeat something so tasteless - it wasn't funny, it was ignorant, but when you are on company time it is a negative reflection of not only you, but your employer.

My family and I have frequented Kabuto for years, but it has deteriorated so significantly we will never return.  The restaurant is run down, and not cleaned thoroughly.  On our trip tonight my four year old asked why it smelled bad when walking in the door.  The quality of the food has substantially gone down while the prices have increased.  The vegetables on the hibachi were not done at all, while the steak I ordered had a rancid taste.  When I complained the \\\"owner\\\" started raising her voice at me in front of my young daughter and three other family members screaming that she would not allow me to say the steak I had been served was spoiled.  There is a reason this restaurant is having to run specials on a large plastic sign out front, and why the last time we visited there was only one other table in the entire restaurant.  It is very sad to watch a once good local establishment run into the ground.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment is Negative because the reviewer had a very unsatisfactory experience at the restaurant.

Nowadays, you can't get them to smile at you. I went to lunch with my mother earlier this week and we were appalled at how bad the customer service was. They close at 2pm and as mom and I walked in at 1:15, the hostess assumed we would have the express. We told her we were having the regular hibachi. Little did we know, she would sit us down with a group that had already ordered their food and the chef was just starting to cook! There were plenty of empty seats on the other grill, and not to mention, since it was only 1:15 of course there were more patrons coming in! The chef had to stop what he was doing several times to ask the waitress if she could take our orders, and help out like she's suppose to. That is not cool. Also, if it's 1:50p and you have patrons coming to your restaurant, you shouldn't have to hurry them out of the door either. I don't like being rushed through my lunch so that you can have 2 or 3 hours to clean or do whatever you do before dinner. When 2:00p rolls around, just lock the door and as patrons leave, just escort them out and lock the door as they leave. It's that simple. We do it all the time in retail.

I thought perhaps we were early, but throughout our meal only one other table with two customers were there and when they left a mother and daughter came in towards the end of our meal.  Our waiter was friendly, he came to refill our waters twice.  Other than that we really didn't see him.  I was a bit disappointed in the selection. There were 3 vegetarian /vegetable options, 3 chicken options and a couple of of other things like soup, potato wedges, and rice pudding that was extremely soupy. I am a vegetarian, so I was already limited in my choices.  At one point I went back to get some more rice and the rice was never refilled, so I was literally scrapping the bowl!  I mostly ate a dish with broccoli in a tomato sauce, which was by far my most favored item on the day's buffet menu.  While I did have an enjoyable time with my roommate, my taste buds were not jumping for joy as I had previously imagined that they would.  I love Indian food, but my experience at Bombay Grille was although not horrible, was also not what I would envision as something to be repeated.\\n\\nNormally at buffets I can usually eat between 2-3 plates.  Their food was extremely heavy and could only eat one full plate.  After leaving the restaurant I took a nap and very long walk afterwards, and I still was full to the point of being uncomfortable.  I am grateful that I did not have to work that day, I would have been miserable.  I even thought that possibly they put heavy cream in their food, but of course I am not in their kitchen, so that will go unknown.  Food has never made me feel that way.  \\n\\nKey points that I was disappointed in were:\\n1. Buffets usually have a great selection, so that a person can sample several different dishes- Bombay Grille failed here.\\n2. Indian buffets usually have at least one dish with paneer- Bombay Grille failed here.\\n3. Indian buffets are supposed to have several different curry dishes (mild, medium, spicy and different kinds of curry). There was only one curry chicken dish.- FAIL\\n4. Bombay Grille- FAILed to refill the rice.. there were only 4 people in there at any given time!!!!  I'd hate to see what the buffet would like after 20 minutes if it was packed or even half way full.\\n5. Where were the spices? It's bad enough that there wasn't any good curry or paneer, but I couldn't taste any spices.  In my opinion, this is an Americanized Indian restaurant. I could not taste any pepper, cardamon, anise, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, saffron, tamarind or turmeric! -FAIL\\n7. Naan- didn't taste like it was homemade.. looked and tasted like store bought and it was plain.. they didn't have garlic naan!  By the time I had some, it was cold, chewy and blah.

As I said, they don't do everything well so I would stay away from the Crab Rangoon and Lo Mein (I am not a fan of that dish anyway). Their soups are just OK so they will do if that is what you really want - just don't expect anything special. The staff is always friendly and they will modify dishes if you request it.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Positive", "rationale": "The review expresses positive sentiments towards the Chinese takeout restaurant despite acknowledging some areas where they could improve.

I was a little concerned at the cost of the meal when I was looking at it online, but the amount of food is well worth the cost.\\n\\nI ordered the teryaki chicken.  You start with an onion broth while the chef is warming up.  Next is the small chilled garden salad served with a pink creamy dressing.  While you are finishing your soup and working on your salad, the chef starts with hibachi veggies (thin sliced carrots, onions, zucchini, mushrooms and broccoli).  Next are hibachi noodles (spaghetti with an oil and garlic ? coating).  Next, if you order fried rice with your meal ($1.75 extra) instead of white rice, the chef does the fried rice and portions it out.  Then the meat is started.  Our table had a variety of steak and shrimp items, which were served first since they cook more quickly than chicken (no one wants rare chicken).  I thought everything was quite good (though my white rice was cold, but that is what I get for not ordering fried rice like everyone else at the table).  All of the preparation is done in front of you by the chef, who puts on a show while cooking.  Very interesting, though I was concerned that I was going to lose my eyebrows when the onion volcano was done.\\n\\nWith 6 people, it was hard to hold a conversation, though not impossible.

I am a peaceful person who would rather cut off my left arm than offend anyone or get into a fight.  But, I swear, B of A brings out a side of me that I wish I never had to see, and the unfortunate part is that I usually end up taking it out on the unsuspecting customer service rep on the other end of the phone line.  I have never in my life banked with a company that goes so far out of their way to screw people over and assess unnecessary fees.  I have paid B of A hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees over the last year due to their screwed up system and logic that they will undoubtedly try to convince you is somehow appropriate.  For example, I made a charge to Food Lion using my debit card and my pin number, which means that charge should come through on my account IMMEDIATELY.  Instead, it didn't come out for two days, on the same day as an automatic withdrawal for a student loan payment.  The financial geniuses at this corporate mega-money factory decided that since they waited for two days to take it out, now they would take the debits out from largest to smallest, with no regard for the date and/or method of payment used.  So, in a nutshell, I was charged two, count 'em two, overdraft fees and when I spoke to customer service, they simply read the policy out of their little manual, attempting to explain it to me like I have an IQ of 50 with no offer to make the situation better even when I threatened to close my account.  Bottom line:  they don't care about me, my money, my life, or my circumstances.  All they care about is whether or not I'm stupid enough to continue paying them overdraft fees.

Since we've seen the place before, we chose to sit upstairs.  \\n\\nNo sooner were we seated, when warm tortilla chips, and two bowls of fresh pico were placed before us.  Tecate was on special, so I gladly order one, my date ordered a coke that didn't taste quite right. (YOU MIGHT WANT TO STAY AWAY FROM THE SODAS.)  Our drinks, including ice-cold water; were brought to us within minutes.  My drink came in a can, however it was accompanied with a frosted-mug and fresh lime.  \\n\\nI order the fajitas-burrito, my date ordered the (grilled) shrimp tacos.  Both orders arrived promptly and smoking hot to our table.   On my plate was a giant burrito stuffed with chicken and steak (I always get the mix), beans, cheese, peppers, and onions, etc.  The outside of the massive burrito was smothered in melted cheeses including guacamole and sour-cream which were splattered across the top.

My friend, who is Mexican, chose to get the rice water (forgot the original name) and it was delicious! Chips and Salsa was plentiful, I didn't care for the salsa at all. Tasted bland and watered down to me. The chips were obviously out the bag, which I don't mind but some salt or some seasoning was needed. \\n\\nI ordered the Street Tacos and my friend got the Shrimp Fajitas. He loved his fajitas! Now, my Street Tacos on the other hand is a completely different story. The tortillas/soft taco shells were greasy and cold. I couldn't even eat them. The items inside the taco weren't that great either. Huge strips of chicken that tasted bland, barely there pico de gallo, and a sprinkle of cheese. There was lettuce and guac on the side. I also asked for sour cream on the side to try to make it taste good. It also came with rice and beans. The beans were beans, nothing special. The rice was the best part of the meal... but it was room temperature which I didn't like much.\\n\\nService is the reason why I will never give the food another chance. Our server was Ingrid. She was pretty great at first. When a Spanish speaking couple came to sit upstairs, she began talking to them so me and my friend had to wait about 10 minutes for the check once we were done eating. Then, she assumed the checks were together and seemed to have a shocked look on her face when I asked to get them split. We had to wait about another 10 minutes for her to finish talking to her manager/co-worker. The thing that that really put the icing on the cake was seeing a charge for sour cream. I wouldn't have minded if I knew when ordering sour cream with my tacos that there would be an extra charge, but to me that is just Serving 101 to tell a customer that all add ons were extra. Paying $1.25 to attempt to make the tacos taste a little bit better was ridiculous. When asked about it she told me, \\\"All add ons have a charge to the ticket\\\". No attempt to atleast say, \\\"I'm sorry, but sour cream has a charge.\\\" I just don't like being surprised when the ticket comes. There was a man, maybe the expo manager or kitchen manager that refilled our chips, salsa, and drinks. I'm not the greatest tipper, but I always tip 25-50% on inexpensive meals so I felt obligated to leave a note telling her that I would've tipped if I knew about the charge and if I could've got the ticket faster instead of watching her chit chat literally right in front of me while waiting for my ticket One of the first times in a while that I didn't tip.

We were given chips and salsa (chips were slightly stale and had no salt on them at all; salsa was AMAZING but served in horribly inconvenient bowls that caused a mess every time you dipped into them) and ordered beers and waters. The beers arrived quickly, but we had to ask not one but TWO more times before we finally got our water.\\n\\nFood-wise, I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas, which were extremely bland. My friend enjoyed his Pollo Borracho, mostly because of the sauce, but overall the food wasn't impressive. Getting our waitress to come back to our table to refill anything (salsa, chips, drinks) or to bring us our check was next to impossible. Honestly the only reason I'm giving Zapata's two stars instead of just one is because I know they were busy (and obviously that affects the quality of service) and because my friend enjoyed his meal, though I didn't like mine.

First, I waited in line for 10 minutes to pick up the script- there was one person at the counter and two other people ahead of me.  When I finally got to the counter, the script wasn't ready even though it had been called in over an hour before I arrived (what's the hold-up?).  The Pharmacy Technician yelled for them to expedite it (great!) and told me to have a seat while they finished filling the script.  Ok.  I sat and listened... and listened... after 10 minutes I asked another Pharm Tech approximately how long it would be until my script was ready.  He looked and told me it was ready.  I asked why nobody had called me and he said he didn't know.  I got back in line again to check out... this time there were five people ahead of me.  After waiting another 15 minutes there's finally only one person ahead of me... the lady at the counter has a cart load of items and the Pharm Tech asks if she'd like to pay for her items there.  I can't say I blame the customer- if I had other items, I wouldn't want to wait in another line, but seriously, there's quite a line of people who can't check out up front at the general registers- let's serve the people to need to use the pharmacy.  She checks out and then proceeds to question the price of baby-wipes (buy one get one half off that didn't ring out as such).  So now the only person checking people out at the Pharmacy is doing a price check for baby-wipes while the rest of us continue to wait.  Finally, a second Tech arrives and takes the woman in front of me and then takes me.  I explain to him my frustrations as it has taken me over 30 minutes to pick up my script and that NOBODY called me when the script was ready.  The Pharmacy Manager tells me that she did call me and I didn't hear her.  I told her I was sitting in the chairs and nobody called her.  She proceeds to say she speaks fast and I probably didn't understand her.  I'm from New York- we don't know how to speak anything except fast- don't insult me!  I continued to explain my frustrations- having to wait in line twice, nobody telling me the script was ready, etc.  She asked how she could address the situation but at that point there was nothing they could do- I had already spent nearly 40 minutes picking up a script that the doctor had called in over an hour before I even arrived.  At this point, I just wanted to get out.  As I left, another customer told me how rude  I was and that I needed to be more patient!  Haha!  Mind your own business- I don't have time to spend 40 minutes picking up a prescription!  When I got home, I was told that CVS has called to say the script was ready- yup, even though I was sitting less than five feet from the counter, they called HOME rather than me!  This pharmacy needs a lesson in customer service and efficiency because both were seriously awful.  I mentioned that I am new to the area- I recently relocated from Chicago and always used CVS there.  My doctor would call in a script and within 10 minutes, the CVS would have it filled (the time it would take me to walk the 2 blocks from my doctor's office to the CVS).  The couple times the CVS was backlogged, they'd have me take a seat but as soon as the prescription was ready, they'd call me up and check me out immediately- I NEVER had to wait in line TWICE!!!

It was visibly dry and not terribly appealing.  I worry for the service industry when servers are expected to serve unappealing food rather than taking it back to the kitchen and getting a fresh plate (Bottom line restauranting).  \\n\\nAnyhow, I am not a problem customer, I just expect a little more for my money than I got.

Bathroom seemed pretty old and looked wore out due to not having a exhaust fan I believe, paint was chipping and could see poor workmanship. However everything in room was clean and didn't feel disgusted at all.\\nBreakfast and dinner are included mon-Friday as is free beer at happy hour. Food is typical quick prepare style yet well presented and not too bad.\\nOh no water provided in room! Which is a tease cause they provide popcorn\\n\\n***update, on the topic of being noisy if your room is by the pool, be aware of the stupid pool gate that has nothing to slow it down. All day, specially during dinner time, people will open it and let it slam shut. Nothing to slow it down or quiet it as it slams. After 8 days of hearing this constantly in the evening and middle of the night (it will wake you up) i believe i have gone crazy and am at the point of yelling at people thanking them for letting it slam :)\\nOther thing is the windows have zero insulation so people just hanging out by the pool having a quiet casual talk late at night will still bug you being you can hear them perfectly.\\n\\nStill keeping my 4 star rating due to how nice the staff is and value this place is.\\n\\n***And to the housekeeper that stole my snickers bar......

The food is outstanding, the wait staff is friendly and accommodating, and the seating doesn't make you feel like you have to rub elbows with your neighbor. \\n\\nThe place is divided into 2 sections. The hibachi grills and the sushi bar. You have a choice of sitting in chairs at the hibachi grills or going into 1 of their rooms where you have to take your shoes off and sit down on the floor (they provide pillows). I haven't had the chance to sit on the floor yet, so I won't include that in my review.\\n\\nYou make your selections off the menu and have some time to sit and chat with other people at the table. Their iced tea is always perfect (whether you get sweet or not), and your glass is always full. \\n\\nThe 1st items to come out are the ginger salad and soup. I normally pass on the soup, but I love their ginger salad. It's not over powering with ginger like most dressings that are in this category.\\n\\nNext comes the appetizers and sushi. I would recommend the calamari steaks (but don't take left overs home, they don't save well) and for the sushi, try the one that has \\\"Pacific or Pacifica\\\" in the name (sorry, I can't remember what it's called). Every time my husband and I have their sushi, it's always fresh and tastes wonderful. \\n\\nThe entertainment begins when the chef comes out to cook your meal. I like how they confirm your order and they pay special attention to any modifications that you've made to your order. This part is great for kids. They cut the tails off of the shrimp and throw them in their hat, light an onion stack on fire and make a train noise with the spatula, and they do an egg roll before throwing it in the air and breaking it in half on the spatula! The meal portions are reasonable and get extra shrimp sauce (it's the pink stuff)! Of course, everything is nice and hot when it hits your plate and fresh because it's cooked right there in front of you. On my first trip there, I was pleasantly surprised that I wasn't hot from the grill (yes, I've been to some places where I was sweating when the cooking was finished).\\n\\nIf you have a birthday, this is a great place to go! You get your meal like always and they give you a cake (that is so sweet, your teeth will rot with 1 bite), they sing to you in Japanese, and you get your picture taken and it is framed (a paper frame, but hey it's still cool lookin).\\n\\nI can keep going on and on about how great this place is. I will keep going back until they close! I do have to point out, if you're not careful, the bill can get a bit high if you keep adding all the goodies they offer.

{"id": "d3585ee7a4f16f5bb2d9db92941fb977", "question": "Lets just say... This place knows how to cut costs! I know that the economy has been hard on everyone, but whoa. I commend this restaurant for taking actions to minimize the amount they spend. This nice restaurant I believe sunk $5 million dollars on the property. Now, I'm going to update my review from my 2011 review. And the outcome, as you can tell by the stars is ummm... not good.\\n\\nNow, lets start off by the menu. I came with a party of 5 and we all got seated down at the hibachi grill. Menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes. I came to Nakato because from word, the owner owns a farm out in Colorado and farm raises all the animals and also their freezer blast freezes their seafood. This is an important fact because when you blast freeze seafood, it's usually 50 or more below 0 degrees Fahrenheit keeping the seafood fresh and bacteria free. So, this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out.\\n\\nSo, lets get back to the menu. Looking at the items something pops out. Fried Rice..$1.75. So, fried rice doesn't come standard with the meal that costs $15+? Steam rice on the other hand is free (which I picked). I ordered the combination of Chicken and NY strip. My party all got the fried rice when it was asked because they were under the assumption that it came with the meal, and I'll break down to you what that fried rice consisted of.\\n\\nFried rice: Eggs, Sesame seed, and Soy Sauce. That's it. No green onions, carrots, and all that other good stuff. On top of the lack of extras with the fried rice it had no taste. Bland.\\n\\nMeats that I ordered weren't bad on the other hand, but the portions were a little too small in my opinion. Their noodles that also came with the meal wasn't filling, and just left me a feeling of not full but at the same time not hungry. And mind, I ate two of my party's portion on noodles.\\n\\nWe also had some tempura. The tempura, I had no taste for it. I've definitely had better. The batter had no taste, as well as the sauce. The veggies that was served in the batter surprised my mother, which found out it was just a whole half of an onion dipped and fried in the tempura. She also wanted to tell me that what made it worse was that the onion had no flavor, the batter, and on top of all that the sauce!\\n\\nFinally lets get on with the end when we pay our bills.\\nSitting with us at our grill was another party of 5, 3 kids and 2 adults. One of the child's birthday happened to be that day. So, you usually get a dessert, or a cupcake, or some ice cream right? Not here! This lucky girl got a nice candle, in a sauce dish. Well, they did sing the birthday song to her.\\n\\nBut wait! That's not it! The table sitting directly across from us also had a birthday. So, they take the candle the little girl just blew out and lights it again to give it to the other birthday person. Mind, these meals cost I believe $15+. Easily.\\n\\nWay to cheap out your customers there, Nakato. Charge extra for fried rice that's bland, and some pretty expensive dishes, with no complimentary birthday dessert.

First off, not even a fan of this place, but it was a coworker's birthday, and she chose to dine here. It was Race Week in Charlotte, but the restaurant was not overly packed near 7 PM. We were seated quickly, and our waiter took forever to even take our drink orders. 15 minutes in, he finally gets our drink orders. Then within the next 15 minutes, he brings out our drinks, one by one...30 minutes in, we finally get the freshly baked foccacia bread (which is really the only thing I like about Macaroni Grill). 45 minutes in, FINALLY takes our damn order. I was so irritated but tried to keep my cool since I was with coworkers. I asked about the pasta sampler which only caught my eye because of the proscuitto mac and cheese. It also included the sausage quadratini and carmela's chicken. I decided to order that to get a variety. We all ordered salads as well to start. About 20 minutes later or so, the diet coke I ordered never came, so I asked for it. Then he slowly brings one salad out at a time. REALLY? First one, no dressing. Second one, no bleu cheese. Third one, no bleu cheese or pancetta. Fourth one, no ranch dressing on the side or pancetta. Mine, no pancetta. Only the caeser salad was the one that came out how it should be. About...30 minutes later (we were there for over 2 hours...we had no issues talking and hanging out, but it was getting ridiculous!) our food finally came out. As the manager started bringing out the dishes, I mentioned that our salads were all wrong (I finally mentioned as I didn't want our food to be \\\"messed up\\\"), and he apologized. Then a server starts to hand me a dish that was completely off and not mine. So...I got to wait for 15 minutes while they re-created my dish, and being the slowest eater of the group, I was tempted to just take it to go. Another dish did not have the mozerrella cheese she had requested. When my food finally came, it was all lacking in flavor.

{"id": "08fa7c3066f207f2ad0ba8550fae56c6", "question": "All right, after a couple of years of sending my animals here, I have to say I have been disenchanted with this place.  Let me tell you why:\\n\\n1. Cost - While I thought this place was expensive before, I really had no realization of HOW expensive this place really is.  It is around $60 for the office visit, any blood work or testing is OUTRAGEOUSLY priced, and even the vaccinations have run much higher than I have ever paid in my life. In one year, I spent more than $2000 in testing, bloodwork, and medication for my dog who was diagnosed with Cushings Disease.  \\n\\n2. No set vet - Please don't get me wrong, I understand there are times when you have multiple vets an office and sometimes they need to cover for each other or consult each other.  However, you have no set vet there, as far as I know.  Any vet could be handling your animal.  It really stinks when you have gotten attached to a particular vet and you can't always see or talk to that vet.  I worry that this affects the quality of care than my animals get there.\\n\\n3. Boarding - So, the last time I have ever boarded my dog was here, and the experience was bad enough that I will now never board my animal again.  My dog had been the vet here and been prescribed medication by the vet for his Cushings disease.  I left specific instructions on his medications and included more food than he would ever really need.  All the food was given to him, more than he probably needed, and of course several doses of his medication were not given to him.  He was there for 5 days.  The manager of the kennel was understanding, and he did refund one day of boarding and the medication fees I paid.  Well, considering each day of boarding is $25 (which seems expensive for the care he got) and I had already paid $125, this was better than nothing but still did not make up for this mistake, as my dog spent a miserable and restless time there.\\n\\n\\nI still appreciate that they participate in a lot of community events, and it is handy that you can do so much online there with the pet portal.  They are great at sending you reminders of vaccinations due with plenty of time to get it taken care of.  I am just not sure that I see the value in all of that compared to the high costs of care.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment is negative because the reviewer expressed dissatisfaction with various aspects of their experience at the veterinary clinic.

He routinely got his nails trimmed, I just don't think they knew what they were doing. Small dogs may be different.\\n\\nMy BIGGEST issue, and the reason I will tell people to be aware...is because they did (or at least were supossed to) do a full check up on him. They said they did blood work as well as a fecal testing. Well, they missed that he was in end stages of cancer!!! We left there thinking our boxer was healthy, but it was so far from true. He had blood tests, vaccines, the whole work up and in fact was diagnosed with an ear infection. (Which by the way was so ridiculously expensive to diagnose and treat. Then the vet admitted she probably didn't need to swab his ear and run diagnostics (because she could tell just from his wax and smell it was infected) so she basically admitted she ran an unnecessary test.  Between the diagnosis and the meds, it was around $75-$100. I also decided to update his vaccines, and they were triple the price of Pet Smarts mobile vaccine clinic. (Don't forget-- you'll also oay the exam fee too!!)  they wanted me to being him back in a week to recheck his ear...at the tune of $60 fee. I told them I'd call if I felt like the meds failed. For what it's worth, I found the same medication online (with a vet prescription) for around $12. Wow, talk about overhead!! \\n\\nShortly after our visit, we visited another vet when we felt something was off with our dog. The new vet  told us how the vet at Stoney creek  must have really dropped the ball. Less than 2 months after our visit to Stoney creek animal hospital, we found out that our boxer was in major organ failure from leukemia. This isn't something that happened in those 2 months, based on his symptoms (which I also reported to SCAH) he had been sick for almost several months.\\n\\nI am not saying  they are the reason we had to put our beloved pet to sleep.

Basically, she brought us a menu, initial drinks, food, and check. Which is kinda odd considering the serving station was a mere 5 feet from us! My water was empty for most of the meal and it never got refilled. Not a huge issue cause I did have my wine :)\\n-Lastly, I don't know if I even have the right to mention this. I mean we did split a meal and that isn't how most couples do it. However, they brought out one salad and one meal. Like no extra dishes, no splitting anything, etc. I mean we are super laid back people so we never said anything and just dug in and ate. However, afterwards, both of us mentioned it to each other. The salad was so big. They could have easily split the amount of lettuce and dressing and just put it in two bowls so we werent reaching across the table. It would have just created one extra dish to clean...big deal.\\n\\nIt's little things like the above that can make or break an experience....especially when there are soooooooo many restuarants in the area.

Although the place looks nice, after searching many places this one seemed to be the best, although we were not overly impressed. She needed to get out of the hospital within 2 days.  I have hesitated saying anything ,because  there are some nice employees there. My Mother's experience was one of total neglect. Aside from being served molded bread on several occasions, they would also bring her meal tray, drop it and go, even though she could not even reach the tray. I think the most overwhelming problem is apathy on the part of employees. If it was not for my sister who was there daily, nothing would have been done. As she could not walk during this time, she was wearing protective diapers with a pad on the bed. On several occasions my sister went in and my Mother had been sitting in her urine for several hours. She even got a sore on her back from it. When my sister removed the pad it was so saturated from sitting for several hours that it fell apart. My Mother needed water. She would call someone. They would always tell her they would be right there. Once a nurse came in and said she would be right back. An hour later she called again and asked what happened. They told her that nurse went to lunch. Now, if this was one or two incidences I might not complain, but this was daily. One nurse came in and told my Mom, \\\"You stink.\\\" Those were her exact words. I would like to know what she would think if someone said that to her Mother! Although my Mother needed rehab to walk, she is of sound mind and very with it. My Mother would tell me she would be calling and the nurses would be in the hall laughing and carrying on, not responsive in the least. Total neglect of a patience's needs. When the director was informed, I think he tried to brush it off. We made several complaints during her stay there. We were not asking for any special treatment. We just wanted my Mother to be taken care of with dignity and respect. If you don't have the humanity to work with older people you need to move on to another line of work.

He dragged me there, because he'd been there before and said it was pretty awesome, me, well I was a little scared of heights.  But not anymore, thanks to InnerPeaks (Just kidding I'm still scared of heights, but that's what makes life exciting, right?)  To get started I had to rent the climbing equipment, including shoes, harness, belays, etc, I think it came to a total of around $25.  then it was go time.  I was a little nervous and I guess the guy at the desk could smell fresh meat, cause he asked me if it was my first time, and I cannot tell a lie, so I told him it was.  Then they took me to a nook of the main floor, which is like a gymnastics floor covered in huge rock climbing walls.  It smells of chalk and the floors are soft and covered in carpet.  I was walked to a corner of the room, near the lockers and watched a video about the proper climbing and belaying procedures, always be in communication with your belay partner...\\\"Climb On\\\"!\\nThen it was off to the walls...Inner Peaks has a ton of different walls for varying skill levels.  I started with the beginner walls which have a slight slope and aren't completely vertical like some of the intermediate walls.  After summitting the first wall I was exhilarated,overcoming my fear of heights and using my brain and muscles to find my way to the top.  So I moved onto the bigger walls toward the front of the place. It had more difficult grips, spaced in a more challenging way, after some effort I made it to the top of this wall, as well.  Rock climbing is an awesome sport, great exercise, challenging both mentally and physically and it helps you use all of your muscles, especially your legs,fingers and forearms.  But that could also be because I'm not using the proper technique.\\nEither way InnerPeaks is awesome, not only do they have some hard core walls that wrap around the entire interior of the building, but they also have little stations where you can work on your grips, techniques and strength training.  And there is a whole section devoted solely to bouldering, like rock climbing, but closer to the ground and without the need for a lot of the equipment.  that means its a lot cheaper to just boulder. But that also takes away the thrill of climbing 30+ feet in the air supporting yourself on nothing but tiny plastic grips and your own determination. So for me it was worth it to pay the $25, get a nice work-out and feel the thrill of being alive and pushing boundaries. InnerPeaks is a great place, check it out, its also the only indoor climbing facility in Charlotte. They offer classes and  programs for all skill levels.

The diner feel of this place gave me the creeps and the whole restaurant turned to stare as we entered.  It was awkwardly quiet and just didn't have a comfortable feel AT ALL.  I wanted to leave from the moment I stepped in but I figured I needed to get over myself and give it a try.  Sometimes the best food comes out of little hole in the wall restaurants.  I wasn't expecting much but I realize decor is not the only thing that matters.\\n\\nWe decided to stick with the absolute basic.  I ordered Spaghetti and meatballs and my husband ordered the chicken parm 12 inch sub.  My husband isn't as picky as I am so I was counting on him to enjoy this sub.  It is pretty hard to mess up a chicken parm sub.\\n\\nMy pasta came out and all I can tell you is that the sauce was brown.  It looked like gravy.  When I mixed it in with the spaghetti it somehow just vanished so it was basically like eating noodles with a hint of brown gravy.  It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted.  I took one bite of the meatball and thought I was going to throw up.  It was atrocious.  It was spongey and tasted like deer meat.  It was so gross.  My husband's chicken parm sub had the same doo-doo brown gravy on it and the chicken was like rubber.  Literally.  He could hardly bite through it.  When he said he couldn't eat this sub, I KNEW it was bad.  He eats anything.  I for darn sure wasn't eating my dish so we just sat their staring at each other.  I forgot to mention the salad and texas toast that was served with the meal...the salad was frozen iceburg with nothing else and the toast was a piece of lilly white bread with some butter and garlic slapped on it.  BLLLLEH!!!!\\n\\nEventually the waitress made her way over to us and we weren't sure what to say but I can tell you I have only not been able to eat a meal due to COMPLETE dissatisfaction twice in my whole life.  The waitress noticed that we didn't eat our meals and asked if we wanted a box to go.  Um, WOW.  No, we want to just get out of here.  We asked for our check and told her we weren't really satisfied but that we didn't want to make a big deal, no need for managers, etc.  Well, one of the \\\"managers\\\" (son to the woman who owns and cooks) came over.  He offered us anything else off the menu to replace our meals.  We didn't want anything else from this dump.  We wanted to just LEAVE and go eat.  We were starving and on a time crunch.  \\n\\nLong story short--They made us pay for the meal that we didn't even touch.  The owner came out and was extremely nasty.  She said she posted that they do not refund for food.  She then pointed to this itty bitty note on her cash register.  She said she can't please everyone's taste buds so she is not going to refund anyone.  What?  So does this happen often enough that you have to have a disclaimer on your food?  That is TERRIBLE servie for a small mom and pop, or just mom shop.  It was like they were used to people not liking their food so they were prepared to argue their point.  IT was bizarre.  I don't understand that concept.  They said you can order a pizza or something else so they are still losing money by having to make a whole other meal!  Either way, it was their approach and the fact that the food was absolutely disgusting.  I would NEVER want to support this place, local or not.\\n\\nI asked them where they were from because no one that was born and raised in Italy would have created the mess that they did.  They were actually greek.  I suppose they just have a different way of preparing Italian food because it was NOT authentic.\\n\\nI looked back at those who offered such stellar reviews and realized that most of the people were from random towns/areas.  Maybe they haven't been exposed to the real deal in terms of Italian food so somehow this place was okay to them.  Not me.  I'm telling you...If you love Italian food and have had real authentic Italian food...DO NOT GO HERE.

I specifically asked the representative if there were any promotions currently available, in order to receive the best price possible.

Just about half the price of the \\\"promotion\\\" the representative offered me.\\n\\n-  I call the representative line to find out what I was told a blatant lie (in nicer terms, of course).  He confirms the promotion is available, but he doesn't have authority to change me to that price.

Our drinks were finished so we ordered more.Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.So we reminded her again.My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well.My partners shrimp though was awful.It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead.They consistently serve quality food along with good service.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment of this review is negative because the customer experienced multiple issues during their visit to the Green Lantern.

The drinks were good and the bartenders were attentive, so no complaints there!  We were seated at a table that had a great view of the lake.  They had lots of specials going on that night (Friday night fish!), and we started with pepperjack cheese curds.  Delish!  They had a really nice bite at the end of them from the peppers.  I got the blue gill/lake perch combo and my fiancee got the Caribbean salmon.  I know blue gill is a thinner fish, and while my dish was good, there was not a lot of actual fish under the batter.  I got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard.  The salmon with the Caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!

After one of the three employees rung me up, I waited several minutes as the barista VERY leisurely made the person in front of me's cappucino. She was literally pulling an espresso, standing for a few seconds talking to the other girl, then steaming the milk, then standing, and so on.\\n\\nAfter she finally finished the other guy's drink, she wiped her area down and took her sweet time to start my drink. It was very obvious I was there waiting, and very obvious that she was just wasting time. Meanwhile, her and one of the other employees started to argue with one another, all the while she does nothing. Finally, I tried to make eye contact with one of them, because I really was in a hurry to get back to Milwaukee.

Originally, Underground Food Collective seemed to be the most logical place for us, but after meeting with them and feeling like we had to change what we wanted to be \\\"hipster\\\" enough to fit their vision and seeing the outrageous price tag that comes with their catering, we knew we had to look elsewhere. Blue Plate listened to what we wanted and was so accommodating. I suggested some recipes and they whipped them right up. They worked with other local businesses, like Batch Bakehouse, and also didn't bat an eye when I suggested two craft cocktails for our bar, one that required the orange peels to be smoked. I wanted to do a lot of the wedding myself and they were happy to allow me to drop off the drink mixes store before the wedding, as well as using my DIY place settings. I have a recipe that my dad has been making since I was a toddler that I wanted for the main dish and they were able to recreate it for us without a problem.\\n\\nThe day of, the service staff was friendly and professional. The food tasted amazing, and there were lots of local foods highlighted. My dad's featured dish was delicious. We had a great bartender who made our fancy drinks taste just like I had imagined. I highly recommend this awesome catering service!\\n\\nIf you want to see our wedding photos and some food pics, you can see them here: http://runningblonde.com/tag/wedding-photos/", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Positive", "rationale": "The sentiment of the review is positive because the reviewer expresses extreme satisfaction with the staff and food quality provided by Blue Plate Catering for their wedding.

If you are looking to hire a caterer for an event, I hope that this review is helpful for you.  \\n\\nI first want to say that it was a pleasure to work with everyone!  From calling in to request some info, to meeting in person, I could tell that Blue Plate was full-service in every aspect of the word.  If Tim was out for the day, I was able to speak with David or Marcia, and everyone was on the same page:  it felt like I had an entire team dedicated to help me every step of the way.  Not only that, but by having Blue Plate do the food, bar, and even chair and table rentals, I was able to save A LOT of money.  \\n\\nThe room was set up early, so we were able to arrive and decorate without having to wait for any tables to be set up, linens to be put on tables, etc.  The room looked exactly like we had discussed in our meetings.  Blue Plate even coordinated with the DJ, florist, photographer, and videographer so that I wouldn't be bothered that day.  Tim had mentioned that Blue Plate was full service, but I had no idea how much they really would do for us.\\n\\nWe had 265 guests, and my wife was a little nervous about running out of food, but Blue Plate, again, hit it out of the park!!  The roast beef was phenomenal (I had tons of guests say it was the most tender beef they had ever eaten), and the executive chef even went out of his way to order in our special food requests just for us.  He even made the entire menu gluten free (many family members have celiac's or are gluten intolerant, myself included).  As a food service worker for my entire life, I was more focused on the level of service...Right on cue, everything was taken care of.  We were even ready to eat 30 minutes early, and the staff got the buffet fully set up within minutes of being informed.  I didn't hear a single complaint the entire night about any of the staff.  To make it better, I didn't even notice that they were there: and that's a great thing!\\n\\nOverall, my wife and I are so happy with the choice that we made:  if I could go back, I'd do it all over again.

I require a side dish of epinephrine if I eat crab, so I appreciate this omission. Now that I have established that I go here just for the cream cheese puffs, it should be clear that I'm far from an expert on Asian food. So take the rest of my review with a grain of salt; there should be plenty to spare in your entree. \\n\\nI used to think this place was ok -- it still has plenty of variety, a very friendly staff, good chili-garlic sauce, decent potstickers, above-average lettuce wraps, no grisly or fatty pieces of meat -- but lately the preparation has been sloppy and the presentation just as bad.

My last order looked like Goldilocks's porridge in the \\\"Three Little Bears\\\" Golden Book I had as a kid. Dull gray, soupy, greasy, salty and watery, yet somehow sticky. The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all, which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find, I was hoping to find something else edible. Epic fail on this entree. \\n\\nOn my next visit, I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken, as a side to my beloved wontons. Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side. The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers had no life left. Again, I hunted and pecked for the chicken, which is consistently decent-quality, well-prepared white meat. My wife's veggie fried rice would have been ok -- they ease up on the salt and Valvoline for this entree -- but the vegetables were overcooked and charred in places. Fresh veggies should present as a bright spectrum of colors -- orange from the carrots, bright green from the scallions, broccoli and pea pods, yellow from the corncobettes. Instead, however, they were the same brown color as the fried rice. \\n\\nMy last fortune cookie said I'll probably return to Chin's.

For a while, it was the next great thing - there always were long lines of families anxious to get their butterfat and sugar fix.  The buzz has faded and now those same families flock to the local froyo joints to get their frozen dairy fix.  I stopped by this weekend while shopping at Greenway Station and found the store devoid of patrons.  I know it's been a long, cold winter, but we Wisconsinites love our ice cream and Babcock Hall was standing room only when I visited later that same day.\\n\\nSo why does my ice-creaming loving family now generally eschew Cold Stone?\\n* Texture - I really prefer a firm scoop of ice cream and that's not what you get at Cold Stone.  The texture is far too gooey for my liking.  It's not terrible, but I much prefer the denser texture of the product at Babcock Dairy or The Chocolate Shoppe any day of the week and twice on Sunday.  The other textural problem is that Cold Stone ice cream melts too fast, so bring a gross of handi-wipes when bringing the kiddos here. \\n \\n* Flavor - The ice cream here is too sweet.  At Cold Stone, it is all about excess, whether it be about the butterfat content, the sugar content or the oversaturated flavorings.  Again, it's not terrible, but it's just not my cup of tea.\\n\\n* Serving Size - The theme of excess carries over to the over-the-top serving sizes.  While I am not a huge fan of froyo, at least I can control my serving size when I visit the near-by Menchies or Orange Leaf.  In addition, while I'm on the topic of serving sizes, can I just add that I detest the cutesy \\\"Like It\\\", \\\"Love It\\\" and \\\"Gotta Have It\\\" serving size names.\\n\\n* Service - When the place first opened, the staff was energetic and responsive.  I admit it was hokey, but I kinda liked the dorky songs they sang when you left a tip.  But now, a trip to Cold Stone is more like visiting a gulag.  Leaving a tip rarely triggers a response, much less a chorus of \\\"Ice cream, baby\\\" sung to the tune of Ice, Ice Baby.  My other pet peeve is that the tables always seem to be sticky, thanks to the soupiness of the ice cream.  It's really kind of a depressing place to visit now.\\n\\n* Pro tip: If you have a peanut allergy, have them clean the stone before they mix your ice cream or you risk cross contaminating your treat.  (I learned that the hard way.)", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment is Negative because the reviewer expresses disappointment with various aspects of their experience at Cold Stone Creamery.

I've got three corgis and after a co-worker referred me here in 2009, I'll never go anywhere else. Every vet my dogs have seen is wonderful...between the three pups I've met with three of the doctors. They're all sincere, empathetic, thorough, understanding, engaging, respectful, and love to share their knowledge. Dr. Haroldson is a sweetheart and can probably put any nervous pet-parent at ease. Dr. Erickson is calm and laid-back, and I can talk to him about even the most awkward pet problems. Dr. Schweitzer is lively--a total hoot.

Not that I'm cheap, it's just that having three dogs adds up.

Although the staff is generally friendly & professional, their competence is questionable.  I could offer a list of offenses but it would take too long & most aren't major, just a little annoying. Concierge lounge is fine, no complaints.  Overall, the hotel gives the impression that it is too large for its operating budget and the competence of the staff.

The linens are old and tired (holes in the sheets & duvet covers, limp towels, some with stains).  I am a platinum member of Marriott and am always booked into a King room.

The next day, the housekeeper had removed the menu from the garbage can and placed it on my pillow.  I know it was the same menu b/c it was creased exactly where I crumpled it up.  Outrageous.

Airport hotels tend to be very outdated and there is typically little incentive to do a renovation because the hotel has a steady stream of customers due to its proximity to the airport and convenience of airport shuttle transportation.  This Marriott has a similar look as the Philadelphia Airport Renaissance.  Both hotels feature an open atrium that goes up 9 to 12 levels high.  You do get a nice look onto the open atrium as you ascend on the quick glass elevators at this property.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this hotel is very out-of-date.  The lobby and cafe looks like something from the early to mid-80s.  The rooms are a little more contemporary though parts very dated; at the kitchenette sink, there was a bottom cabinet that may have been a dishwasher at one time; instead, it was empty with lots of dust and exposed piping (not nice to find at any hotel).\\n\\nThe breakfast buffet did not inspire freshness either.  The food quality was not horrible, but a lot of the food was quite salty.  Food options included bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, continental breakfast options, and an omelet bar.  In addition, the poor lighting in the lobby and throughout the hotel made the food and other stuff maybe feel worse than they actually were.\\n\\nThis Marriott is still a comfortable place to stay and has good customer service.  The rooms are comfortable with good beds and linen.  The room temperature was fine though the unit did not seem to consistently keep the room cool.  The shower was fine.\\n\\nThis Marriott has many suites so you have a good shot of getting upgraded if you are a Marriott Rewards Gold or Platinum member.  The suites are spacious and the bedroom is separated from the living room area with a door.  Their suites are outfitted with a mini fridge, kitchen sink (as mentioned) and a microwave.\\n\\nOn weekends, Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members get an offer of full breakfast buffet for two per Saturday and Sunday or 750 Marriott Rewards points per Saturday and Sunday.  This is a new nationwide Marriott benefit for Marriott Rewards Gold and Platinum members and the hotel is only obligated to offer a continental breakfast.  I have been to a few properties (Santa Clara Marriott, Minneapolis Marriott City Center) that are only doing the bare minimum--continental breakfast--so this Marriott is definitely going above and beyond in this area (though the quality of the full breakfast buffet, as already mentioned, was not that great).\\n\\nThe front desk was nice and helpful.\\n\\nRoom rates are good, but this hotel is not in Downtown Madison.  It is only a 7 to 10 minute drive to Madison though.  However, I am not sure if getting to Downtown Madison on a Wisconsin football game day is challenging.\\n\\nThis Marriott would not be a good property for a long stay.  This hotel just does not feel fresh enough.  It is a comfortable enough spot for a short stay though due to their comfortable rooms and good service.

I held an event there in 2010 and the events coordinator at the time, Diana??, and the service were great.

I don't think the fryer was hot enough, because these curds were drenched in grease - so much so that we couldn't eat them.  Disgusting.  And the ranch dipping sauce was like water... you know what they say about oil and water... \\n\\nThe rings were decent, but again - the grease was ridiculous.  It really made for a bad first impression.  So, we ordered some Whiskey Old Fashioned Sours to help cut through the grease film that was sitting so heavily on our palettes.  \\n\\nOur table was ready by 7:00-ish, and much to our surprise, when we went upstairs this time, the place was packed.  Where those people came from, and how they got up there without us noticing remains a mystery... our waitress stopped promptly, checked our drinks, and took our order - fried perch all the way around with hash browns on the side.\\n\\nDinner salads came first and were nice; fairly fresh, fairly tasty, and just the right size.  Fish came out slightly later - served family style - along with our hash browns.  First bite of the fish?  UGH - it tasted awful.  Extremely fishy flavor (and I love fish).  Think \\\"stinky NJ ocean shore line flavor\\\" - not delicate, flavorful, flaky, and enjoyable.  No sir, this was the nightmarishly bad fish that we all remember from our grade school days - you know, the stuff that was about 2-3 days away from being used as feed for the sea lions at the zoo  \\n\\nSo, we doused it with lemon and gave it another go - and once again, the fish was so overpoweringly fishy that we reached for the (gasp!) ketchup.  That helped a bit, but it still wasn't an enjoyable fish fry.  The fish was cooked well - not too greasy, and it was breaded rather than battered.  If only it weren't so obscenely fishy...   \\n\\nHash browns were tasty - fried nicely (crisp and tasty).  Service was fantastic - our waitress was fun, helpful, and did a great job of checking in with us.  Total bill for three with a round or two of drinks was $45-ish.\\n\\nStamm House = FAIL\\n\\nFood: 1 star (grease, grease everywhere; horrible fish fry)\\nService: 4.5 stars \\nValue: 3 stars\\n\\n\\nSummary: waaaaay too greasy + waaaaaay too fishy fish = fail.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment of the review is negative because the reviewer extensively discusses various disappointments with the food quality at Stamm House.

With the ATM down, I made my way to the soda area so that I could buy a Diet Coke and then get cash back from the register. Their soda prices are a good $0.30 higher than anyone else. I shouldn't be surprised, nor should I be complaining about this, as it's no secret that Walgreens generally charges a premium for anything in their store.\\n\\n- Checkouts are slow. I got into line to check-out with my Diet Coke. I was 7th in line. One cashier. After 5 people were checked out (only one more person in front of me), the cashier fires-up the microphone and asks for more checkout assistance.

All new equipment and works great. \\n\\nI have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \\n\\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. \\n\\nI have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\\n\\nI have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.\\n\\nThe only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot.

To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.\\n\\nWe arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\\n\\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.\\n\\nAfter the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.\\n20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \\\"oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\\\"\\n5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \\\"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\\\"\\n5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.\\n\\nThey were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.\\n\\nFinally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:\\nFish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\\n\\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\\n\\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.

Yes, I could save a ton of money on parts by buying items online, but as mentioned, I respect dealerships and understand the benefits of supporting local businesses.  \\n\\nThat said, this particular VW dealership (the Zimbrick on Century Avenue is only a VW dealer, BTW - no Acura any longer at this location) shocked me with their inability to comprehend a simple request for oil, an oil filter, and a fuel filter.\\n\\nI called to check the price and availability for some common, everyday maintenance items for my VW Jetta.  My Jetta has the 1.9L BRM Diesel motor (\\\"PD\\\" style), and as such has some unique requirements as identified by Volkswagen, specifically when it comes to oil.  VW mandates that you use their 505.01 approved oil in the BRM diesel motor.  Failure to do so may result in a voided or compromised warranty.\\n\\nSo imagine my shock when the parts guy told me to use \\\"any old oil\\\" while on the phone.

I then gave him my VIN, and he was still confused.  A few minutes later, he quoted me the correct filter, but at a price that was easily 2x higher than what I would pay from any other online VW parts dealer.\\n\\nSo, I declined to purchase anything from this local resource, and will now have to shop online with an out-of-the-area dealership.

First of all, we ordered for delivery tonight, on New Year's Eve. Hey, I get it; NYE is a busy holiday for restaurants, so it's not like I expect a 30 minute delivery time. But when an hour and a half passed without our food, we called to check in. They told us, \\\"Sorry, we only have one delivery driver for more than 30 orders.\\\" Um... ok? Why, when you know it's a holiday, would you not staff more drivers? So that was ridiculous right off the bat. Then, our food arrived (about an hour and 45 minutes after we ordered), and I would have forgiven the long wait had the food been amazing (or even good!). Sadly, this was not the case. I ordered the children's chicken fried rice for my kids, and I was honestly scared to give it to them when I opened the container and saw the cold, gray, limp chicken lying within the rice. My kids tried it and promptly spit it out. My order (the cashew chicken) was limp and spongy; the only slightly passable thing we ordered was the General Tso's chicken. Although even that, while it had excellent flavor on the breading and sauce, provided way more gristle than I expect to ingest when eating from a restaurant. \\n\\nSo we may (if all other options are exhausted) give it another try, because hey, maybe it was just a fluke bad experience because of New Year's Eve.

I was struggling with my bills and though I had taken out the insurance for job loss, they found a loop hole and didn't credit me with the insurance, even though I had been paying the extra $50 for the insurance for over 2 years. Then I contacted them multiple times trying to reasses my monthly payment, as I couldn't keep up with all of my bills, I spoke with Mary in the finance department and through our conversation she was rude and extremely hostile. She accused me of lying when I told her I had been calling in and trying to find a solution, when I asked her if I still paid my payments but paid less, she said that they would send me to collections for not making the full amount. Then she looked in my account and saw that I had money in there (enough for only 2 months of rent and my bills... will no real income coming in) and said that there was obviously no reason I was having problems and I shouldn't have even called her. I was really frustrated, I was trying to negotiate so I didn't have to file bankruptcy. Then after I could no longer pay, due to my dire financial situation, they took out all the money I had in my account and applied it towards the loan... i.e. my rent, without any phone calls or letters reaching out to me before they were going to take my money.

He fishes primarily for cod and salmon, and supplies several very well known restaurants with his bounty. His fish is top notch and without compare - truly great stuff. \\n\\nHe wanted to try Wilson's, as he doesn't supply them with fish and is always looking for opportunities to expand his distribution footprint in and around the area.\\n\\n+ Huge space. Shockingly huge - rectangular in shape, the building is at least 4-5 times deeper than it is wide. \\n+ Bar runs the entire length of the building\\n+ Nice selection of taps and bottles available\\n+ Was quite surprised to find Abita Strawberry on tap\\n\\n+ Tons of televisions; our high-top had its own TV\\n- Very noisy due to all of the televisions going\\n\\n- All tables were dirty; staff wasn't too good about wiping down after people left\\n- Our server was quite gruff, not terribly helpful, largely absent, and forgot to bring refills of drinks and waters\\n\\nSo... all of that stuff aside, let's talk about the fish.\\n\\nTwo options for fish: 3-piece or 5-piece deep-fried cod. No baked cod, and no other fish varietals. \\n\\n+ The cooking area is in plain view of the entire restaurant\\n- You'll leave smelling like a deep fryer\\n- We watched as our fries sat and languished on plates for a good 5+ minutes while the fish cooked\\n- We watched as our completed plates loitered in the cooking area for another 5+ minutes after the fish was done; our server was busy running around helping other tables while the fish sat...and sat... and sat... \\n- Before we were finished eating, our cranky server began clearing a space directly behind us so that they could set-up for karaoke. That's all well and good, but the guy kept bumping stuff into us (the bar stools don't have backs)... he was like a bull in a china shop.\\n\\n+ Batter on the cod was delicious, if not quite salty.

But in the last few years, other venues in Madison have really stepped up their game, and the Barrymore doesn't seem to care about keeping up with its contemporaries.\\n\\nIts use of social media is near-archaic. The venue doesn't make an effort to create or even update pages for individual events, and good luck if you get any indication that a show is on track to sell out. And perhaps it's just my personal taste, but the Barrymore used to bring in excellent music acts on a much more regular basis. Now it just caters to the aging-hippie population of the neighborhood, preferring to fill its schedule with predictable offerings about far-left-leaning politics. These events don't offend my own political views, but they're often dull and serve as nothing more than an echo chamber for people who want their beliefs perpetually reaffirmed. They sell more tickets that way, so I'm not sure I can blame them for the strategy, but  I hardly ever like the shows there. Also, the tickets are 2-3 times more expensive than the tickets usually are at other live entertainment venues in town.\\n\\nThe building itself isn't falling into disrepair, like the Orpheum is (heartbreakingly, I might add), but areas of infrastructure could certainly benefit from attention. There is no public WiFi, and you'll be hard-pressed to get cell phone reception, even in the balcony. I do appreciate that the open dance area is slanted a bit so that we vertically-challenged folks have a chance to see, but if you want to be able to sit and see the acts, the balcony is your best bet. It's not often open, however, especially for shows that haven't sold a ton of tickets. I don't recall this being a problem at prior events, but at the show I attended last night, there were constant problems with microphone feedback, often necessitating acrobatics by the band itself. The tap beer selection is good, but that's pretty standard in this town. Bottled beer selection pales in comparison to other venues, and the liquor and wine options are slim pickings. The bar is cash-only. The only ATM in the place charges a $4 fee for each use, so if you need to withdraw cash, make sure to get enough in one go. The line can be enormous, and often is bisected by people exiting and entering the theater. The bathrooms are fairly clean and well-stocked, although I've used them on more than one occasion to discover that they were out of soap, necessitating the use of their hand sanitizer instead.  Also, the saloon-style doors are an easy way to get smacked in the face entering and exiting the bathroom, so exercise plenty of caution around them. The bathrooms are so tiny that the lines are formed outside the doors. They also don't sell earplugs, so make sure you bring your own.\\n\\nBottom line: in the rare event that they have a show I want to see, I'll go, but I make sure to bring plenty of cash, my own earplugs, and my plastic Barrymore cups (drinks are 50 cents cheaper when you remember to bring your cups back).", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment of the review is negative because the reviewer highlights numerous shortcomings and areas of dissatisfaction with the Barrymore venue.

{"id": "f16fdee7e91d3562be06e194292fcd57", "question": "The Saturday before Halloween is apparently not something the good folks of Madison, Wisconsin take lightly. #Freakfest\\n\\nI found myself in town visiting friends who live in the Madison-metro area and make it a point to celebrate the State street festivities every year. They live about 5 or so miles from the actual fest and because drinking and driving is never in style, they'd gone ahead and arranged a day in advance for 2 cabs to come pick our group of 7 up at their place of residence at 8:45pm. \\n\\nNow, this was my virgin visit to Madison at Halloween time so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, though I can't say I wasn't warned. I knew streets would be closed down and blocked off and this wouldn't be your typical Madison experience, but without seeing the Mad city madness first-hand, it was hard to anticipate just what we were up against when it came to our group versus on-time transportation on this hallowed eve. \\n\\nUnion Cab did miss the mark as far as sending the two cabs that we'd ordered more than a day in advance to arrive at 8:45pm. The first cab arrived at 9pm to pick up the first half of our group off at the fest, but when the first group arrived at said bar and realized that the second group had still not been picked up, they asked if that cab could go back and get us, ya know, since there was supposed to have been another cab there 30 minutes earlier anyway. But the driver said they were unable to locate the second cab and that it was against the rules to come back and pick up the second group who were still waiting since they were not the assigned cab. Makes very little sense, but at the same time is sort of understandable on such a crazy eve, but the reservation should've counted for something. \\n\\nWhen we (the second group still at the house) tried calling Union, all we got were busy signals being that it's one of Madison's busiest cab nights of the year. So naturally, we did the only thing we could... crack open another beer and wait and chug and wait and chug and wait. It was just before 10pm when our cab finally arrived. The driver was super fun, quirky and costumed for the holiday and quickly made us forget about how Union had failed to provide us with transportation until over an hour after the previously scheduled and agreed upon time.\\n\\nAlso worth noting, because it won Union back a lot of stars that would otherwise have been missing given the tardiness, is how immaculate the shiny, gleaming Toyota Prius cab was. It smelled divine, and not overpowering or like it had something to cover up. And -get this- it had cloth seats. CLOTH SEATS. It didn't smell like sh*t. ZERO crumbs. Sans stains. Not even a whiff of urine or vomit. Where the hell was I? Bizarro World, surely. \\n\\nSo, while I don't know that I'd trust Union as my chariot on a big day where I needed to be somewhere in a timely manner (ala the airport), they were plenty fine for a casual booze-bender and the amenities (no puke stains or pee smells) made the ride a pretty enjoyable one.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Positive", "rationale": "The sentiment of the review is positive because the reviewer acknowledges the challenges faced with transportation on a busy night like Halloween in Madison.

I didn't to to leave, have them call my name and miss my slot. \\n\\nMy name gets called and I think it's time for my to get my TB. Instead, I must go up and fill out paperwork. Why couldn't this be done sooner? The receptionist was quite rude. She was trying to do too many things as once instead of giving me proper attention. No professionalism at all. At any rate, I filled out the paperwork and went to sit back down.

Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison's finest.\\n\\nDetailed Review:\\nThe Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter's Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot.  The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye.  \\n\\nWe put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange.  I'm sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish.  \\n\\nRegardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually.  So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn't a problem.  Dexter's recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. \\n\\nWe immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup.  I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad.  The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could've been a little warmer.  I'm told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good.\\n\\nThe waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp.  He said he'd be back in 10 minutes with our fish.  \\n\\nNearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish.  She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us.  The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter's doesn't strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover.  \\n\\nCurds were excellent - not your typical \\\"from the bag\\\" curds, which was a nice surprise.  They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly.\\n\\nFish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait.  The cod was phenomenal.  Three huge pieces with a mound of fries - now that's what we're talkin' about.  The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful.  The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored.  I loved every single bite of it.\\n\\nI also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp - both of which were excellent as well.  Huge props to Dexter's for their fish fry - it's definitely a top-10 offering.\\n\\nIn the end, they also made things good as the waiter comp'ed us our drinks and curds, so we got out of there for under $40.

However, when we went back a month or so later, we had a horrible experience.  We had to wait nearly 45 minutes for our food and then when we got it- it was terrible.  My boyfriend had the garlic chili fries and they arrived not only COLD, but DOUSED in disgusting grease- they were inedible.  We mentioned it to the waitress and she offered to bring a new order, but it turned out the new order was just as terrible as the first one.  I had the roast beef sandwich and it was horrible- very dry and bland.  To her credit, the waitress did give us free cupcakes to take home to make up for the horrible food (although it turned out the cupcakes were also inedible and terrible).  \\n\\nWe hoped this was just an unusually busy night and not the norm, and because the fish fry is so good, we went back again tonight, hoping for a better experience.  We were wrong!  We went around 7 and waited 15 min or so for a table.  Once we were seated we placed our order right away with the waiter, since we already knew what we wanted.  An hour later, we were still waiting for our food.  All we ordered was the fish and waffle fries- so nothing complicated- and on such a busy night, you'd think they'd be making sure to keep batches of fish and fries going steadily into the fryer.  When we finally got our food, it was the tasty fish we'd remembered from before, but by that time, we were so tired and crabby from having to wait for so long, it wasn't quite so enjoyable.  After our meal, we had to wait quite a long time for the waiter to bring the check, and then he didn't come back to pick it up for a good 15 minutes.  We would still go back to Dexter's just for drinks, but I don't think we'll be going there to eat the food anymore.  Two terrible experiences with inexcusably long waits is enough to keep us from going back for dinner.  It's too bad because the fish is good, but not good enough to justify the SLOW service.\\n\\nEdit: Turns out the fish wasn't so good- ended up being up all night with food poisoning.

Here are a few things I suggest to make your experience supremely successful:\\n\\n1. Go there with a plan. As you've read it can be overwhelming to navigate the tight aisles with a large cart and huge crowds. Do some research online, look at photos, and make a list of the things you're looking for. It's much easier to shop if you have an idea of what you want. It's sort of like buying groceries on an empty stomach. Imagine spending all day pushing a cart up and down store aisles unable to make solid decisions because of your ravenous hunger. Shopping Klein's with an empty garden or empty pots is similar. Also, tuck your cart in a corner and walk the aisles instead trying to push the cumbersome thing around. \\n\\n2. Go on a day that's a bit overcast. I went twice this summer just before some rain rolled in, and because the sun was tucked behind a few clouds most of the time I was there, it was much more comfortable inside. If you can, look at a weather report and shop when you know it won't be hotter than Hades. \\n\\n3. Don't be afraid to ask multiple people, multiple questions. And if you're not satisfied, tell them! The folks I encountered on my most recent trips wanted to steer me in a direction I wasn't interested in because it wasn't part of my plan, and eventually they guided me to plants that would help me achieve the overall look I was going for on my balcony. It was important for me to realize that certain folks will gravitate towards certain plants simply based on personal preference. I learned to say things like, \\\"I don't like ferns, what else will grow like a fern in an area that doesn't get a ton of sun, but isn't a fern.\\\"\\n\\n4. Take someone who knows what they're talking about. I walked the aisles with a dear friend who happens to be a master gardener and she was instrumental in telling me more about plants, what types would thrive on my balcony, and which to stay away from given the climate change and season transitioning we are experiencing this September. Maybe you don't know a master gardener but have a neighbor with a yard you envy.\\n\\n5. Go outside. I had no idea the selection outside was so vast.

Far past the expiration date; 2. Poor quality; 3. Stale. Of the expired items I can recall, one was a package of tortillas, purchased in the last few days that expired 12/09/13! Almost a full month past expiration! A month ago, I bought hummus. It didn't look right when I opened it (mold), & of course, it had expired 2 weeks earlier. Fortunately, we didn't eat the hummus. Unfortunately, we discovered the tortillas had expired in the middle of dinner. \\n\\nThere've been a handful of instances where rolls/breads are stale, particularly from the bins by the registers. Rolls weren't just hard on the outside or a day past fresh-baked, we're talking inedible. It's incredibly disappointing too, when you're looking forward to good bread. \\n\\nThen there's the deli, where there's been a few issues. \\n\\nDeli issue #1: My wife bought sliced deli meat, a cut known for being fatty, but this one was overly so. It was slimy, chewy, tough, flavorless, & ultimately inedible. It was the first time I've returned meat. I'm a carnivore. I've had hackepeter, steak tartare, tripe, chitlins, sheep brain, sheep testicle... things most people won't eat. This particular deli meat however, was a few steps beyond. \\n\\nDeli issue #2: More an observation, which now prevents me from buying from the previously liked, pre-made deli salad section. One time at the deli counter, I saw a JSM worker \\\"clean\\\" the front of the pre-made salad case, from the inside, with a towel. Mind you, none of the salads were taken out of the case or covered for the cleaning process. So when this worker brought the towel back out of the case, I was aghast to see a dirty towel, with all sorts of crumbs, crumbles, food pieces & products, being carried haphazardly, over uncovered salads. I saw some bits fall from the towel, over the salads, as it was brought out of the case. \\n\\nDeli issue #3: A JSM worker cut slices of meat & cheese, kindly packaging them with care. However, he did so without gloves & without washing his hands. I was pretty much done with the JSM deli at this point. \\n\\nYou can have all the locally produced, environmentally friendly, organic, small batch, artisan &/or handmade, gluten-free, nonsense all you want. It does no good however, when it's stored in unclean, unsanitary conditions, &/or expired all together. If I were a \\\"freegan\\\" I'd say this place was a rip-off. Everyone knows you can get spoiled foods in dumpsters behind most grocery stores, for free. I'd also make exceptions for small \\\"mom & pop\\\" businesses, but I have standards & limits.

Don't get me wrong, this is clearly their regional interpretation, Im all about the authentic experience, and this was good sauce.  But, I confess that for my leftovers I'm making some tahini sauce.\\n\\n- Hummus.  You know, hummus is always a crap shoot for me.  I make my own, from dried chick peas, and I've been working on this recipe for 25 years (along with my Bloody Mary recipe and about a hundred others). This is another of those regional interpretation issues, this was my least favorite today.  I'll try it again, because my own hummus has on and off days.  This was just more on the bland side than I expected,  No one distinct flavor dominated so I felt like it was left with an almost indescribable flavor.  Not bad, totally edible, just oddly unflavored.  I added some lemon and salt, which helped some.  \\n\\nSarma - if you're expecting dolmathes this will be familiar in flavor, but it texture.  These are served cold with a yogurt dipping sauce.  I'm okay with the temperature, but I just like a little lemon on mine.  These are veg, the rice filling is cooked down to a coarse 'risotto-y' consistency.  I dig them, but those who prefer the snap of dolmathes will find these softer, but just as flavorful\\n\\nAll in all, outstanding.

A mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag.  This was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and I found this soup to be disapointing.   \\n\\nLamb Saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing 12.95. It's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and I lost a little of my appetite, though the lamb was tender and cooked well.  The overall dish was very very salty with no special taste.  Just a little spicy, a little Indian, and a little lamb.  They are probably using curry paste from a jar, or there is just not a very imaginative cook in the kitchen because the whole dish was lacking in flavor (besides salt).  A whole cardamom pod was left hidden in the diarrhea sludge, which led to an unpleasant burst of cardamom in one bite.\\n\\nRice had clearly been sitting around for awhile and was very dry throughout with crunchy bits and very chewy bits.  I just don't see how this is acceptable to serve someone in a restaurant.  Rice is one of the cheapest ingredients out there.  If the rice has been sitting for too long, throw it out and make more.  \\n\\nI tried the saag with the rice and the oily mess of lamb Saag rehydrated the rice somewhat, and the rice's absorption of the Saag took away some of its saltiness.\\n\\nThree sauces or chutneys that came with the papadom were not very good at all. \\n\\nHad to ask to have my water glass filled every single time I finished it.

It's one of those things we hate because it's annoying, it takes time out of our schedules, and it's often painful.  No matter how we brush our teeth, we are prone to cavities.\\n\\nMidwest Dental isn't horrible.  I've had maybe five or six dentists in my life at this point, and I can probably say that of those that I've had, Midwest is the worst of them, but even still--they're not horrific.\\n\\nMidwest tends to assign you a hygienist so you see the same person every time you go. This is the first dental practice I've visited where this is the case. Every other one I went to, the hygienist was whomever was available.  \\n\\nMy first hygienist at Midwest was a young girl, fresh out of her two-year program, I believe.  She was nice enough, and competent, but she was a kid.  She liked kid things.  My first visit, while she had hands in my mouth and I couldn't scream at her that I didn't give two flying figs, she told me all about what had been going on during \\\"The Bachelorette\\\" that season.  The second time, she asked me what I was reading (I had a book with me), and then told me all about how much she loved \\\"Twilight.\\\" \\n\\nI was dreading a third uninformative visit with her, but she moved.  So, I was reassigned to a new hygienist.  Again:  A nice enough, competent hygienist, but not someone with whom I want to have a conversation. She still works there, so I won't go into too much detail in case she ever reads this.  She's a wonderful person, but I'm an introvert by nature. I don't want to make small talk.  I don't want to hear about her kids. I don't really tell people about my kids--why do I want to hear about yours, lady?\\n\\nThe hygienist is absolutely brutal with the dental floss.  She hammers that wax garrote up and down my teeth with all the subtlety of a teenage boy groping boobs for the first time.  \\n\\n\\\"Oh, your gums are bleeding.  You're not flossing enough.\\\"\\n\\nLady, I floss every friggin' day.  My gums don't bleed when I floss.  Maybe it's because you're trying to go THROUGH the frickin' tissue instead of along the tooth?  Don't even get me started on her skills with the violent metal pick.  She has cut me like Wolverine.\\n\\nThey also really like to indict you on anything you do food and drink-wise at this place.  \\\"Your teeth show wear.  Are you drinking soda?\\\"\\n\\nYeah, a can or two a day.  But I brush.\\n\\n\\\"YOU SHOULD NEVER DRINK SODA!  IN FACT, IF YOU LIVE IN A COUNTY WITH A SODA BOTTLING PLANT, YOU HAVE TO MOVE!

Once in the morning before I leave for work, and again at night.  Sometimes I sneak another one in there sometimes.\\n\\n\\\"How many minutes, though?\\\"\\n\\nTwo or three per session, plus flossing at night.\\n\\n\\\"YOU SHOULD BRUSH YOUR TEETH FOR THIRTY HOURS.  NEVER STOP BRUSHING.  YOU'RE NOT BRUSHING ENOUGH.\\\"\\n\\nWell hell, lady...\\n\\nThey also like to sell you extra crap that you may or may not need.  \\\"Here--here's a special paste you should rub on your gums.

{"id": "94200105da3fa606f60bc9e0a89758d9", "question": "I take my BBQ seriously and because of that I researched on-line via Yelp and other sites various reviews of BBQ places in Madison, finally deciding on Smoky Jon's No 1 B-B-Q.  Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she'll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn't understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.\\n\\nSo I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I've had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don't get it.  Almost every other place I've eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The \\\"sugar-fried\\\" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn't look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn't need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.\\n\\nI strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you'll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I'll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.\\n\\nOh well...", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment of this review is Negative because the customer experienced multiple issues with their order, including receiving the wrong food items, overcharging, and receiving subpar food quality.

Located nearby the airport, the well-lit, wooded interior starts with a pathway that leads to the large overhead menu, the ordering counter, and the dining area. Adding to the d\\u00e9cor are the statewide accolades all around the walls. On this evening, the casual atmosphere happened to be unexpectedly subdued, quite unlike the other BBQ restaurants I've visited.   \\n\\nWe shared a Combination Meal ($17.75) that included our choice of 1/3 Slab, Smoked Pork Shoulder Sandwich, and extra serving of smoked pork shoulder, Cole Slaw, and BBQ Baked Beans. The Slab/Pork Ribs were smoky, tender, and the meat easily peeled off the bones. There was an excellent hint of smoke to deepen its flavor, and that was further enhanced by the BBQ sauce to provide a sweet higher note, strong black peppery secondary, and anchored by a noticeable spicy kick that reverberates with good hops. For the price, there wasn't enough meat on the ribs, but the flavors were still sensational. The dinner roll that this dish came with was sweet, soft, and spongy. I loved it.\\n\\nThe Pork Shoulder Sandwich was excellent as well. The pork shoulders were tender without one single dry spot--perfectly executed and delicious without the BBQ sauce. The meat was flavorful and deepened by its smoky flavor that coupled perfectly with the well-rounded, full-bodied spicy BBQ sauce. I absolutely loved it except for the buns that turned out flaky with hollow spots and lacking flavor. We finished the meat without getting into the buns very much. This sandwich could have been so much better with a bun of higher quality. \\n\\nThe BBQ Baked Beans were smooth, sweet, and delicious. The Slaw on the other hand was too wet with a weak texture. Compared to other BBQ joints, their sides could use more varieties such as green beans, collard greens, yam and other possibilities to complement this resounding BBQ. They also have two sauces, and I wished we had the option of trying both at the table.\\n\\nService was impatient at first, as we were initially tentative and indecisive about our choices. I wished the server could have been much more educational with their strengths and limitations to help us make the right decisions on this very first visit. However, she later became much more warm, accessible, attentive, and helpful towards the middle and end of the meal. Price-wise, their items were pricy with the portions we received.

In reading through all of the reviews, the one thing noticed is that the vast majority of positive reviews are unable to compare to bbq eaten in the known meccas of this country, while the negative reviews have many comparisons to KC, Texas, S Carolina, etc, etc.....  you know, the people that have been around and actually do KNOW what it is they are APPRECIATING.\\nKnowing that you HAVE won numerous awards in these very places, you would think that you wouldn't fall back on the review rating of those that don't know any better. No slam, I didn't know bbq from bratwurst until I started traveling either, but maybe it would be best to show WI what good bbq is, and not high-five yourself for being better than burgers and brats off the old Weber.... as my review stated, your place does have the potential to do that.\\nSo, while respecting your opinion as well, I still must disagree with you, and have offered all of the actual reasons for doing so. In the end, it's your business, run it how you will - just don't point at awards for sauces you don't offer, years of experience when it's not you at the pit, and a canned reply to those of us that know bbq stating we must not know how to appreciate it..... \\nAlso - my original review had everything in it regarding how to raise your food up to my, and many others, standards. Fix those issues, and I'll give it another shot. \\n\\nBest Regards,\\n\\nCaleb\\n\\n\\nHi Caleb,\\n\\nThanks for your feedback, I respect your opinion but I must disagree with you. As you can see on the other reviews and by the awards we have won, our BBQ has great quality and taste. Also, we've been on the market for over 25 years, which makes us a great BBQ tradition for those who know how to appreciate it. Please contact me next time you visit us and we'll make sure our food is up to your standards.\\n\\nBest,\\nJon Olson \\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW\\n\\nI'm not sure why this place has 4 stars - was some of the worst bbq (with potential, will explain after I complain) that I've had. I also get that this IS Wisconsin, and bbq has a whole different meaning than in the bbq meccas around the nation, but damn....\\n\\nOrdered 1/2 rack w 1/2 chicken, 1/3 rack w pork shoulder sandwich, and 1/3 rack w brisket sandwich. Sides of baked beans, mashed potatoes, and mac-n-cheese. So, pretty good variety of what they offer. \\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- membrane not removed from ribs - trying to eat meat stuck to a huge piece of essentially dried and smoked skin as the bones are pulled apart is pretty gross. Any pitmaster or fan of bbq knows this needs to be removed prior to smoking, any other explanation boils down to plain laziness. Fully half of the meat was stuck to the membrane as it fell off the bones. And a star is lost!\\n- chicken was smoked beyond merely dry - think chicken jerkey. And a star is lost!\\n- both sandwiches were minced meat to the point of being indistinguishable from one another in both taste and appearance. Where are the slices of brisket and juicy chunks/shreds of pork? Not here. And a star is lost!\\n- only one bbq sauce is offered standard, the only other flavor (same sauce, only spicier) has to be ordered separately and at extra cost. Sides were very small (about 2oz) and nothing extraordinary - mac-n-cheese was somehow \\\"flour-ey\\\" with overcooked noodles. Can't imagine what end piece of corn with 5 kernels I would have received had I ordered that. And a star is lost!\\n\\nThe \\\"potential\\\":\\n\\nThe taste of the ribs was not bad, the chicken as well. I think if the \\\"pitmaster\\\" was given a raise and some training, or given the boot and replaced with someone qualified to run the pit, the food could be brought to par. I also think it's not to much to ask for a wider variety of sauces - where are the sauces that all of the newspaper clippings on the walls referencing Smoky Jon's contest awards at? Quit being cheap with the sides. I like taters, more than 5 bites please!! Hook up the mac with some cheese!! I support small businesses and love bbq, give me a reason to!!\\n\\nThe \\\"good\\\":\\n\\nStaff is friendly. Most of the food had good flavor, but fell way short on the prep/handling end.

However, this review is mostly based off of a shopping experience that I undertook there.\\n\\nI was in the market for a couch and shopped around at a lot of places, wasn't looking for anything too fancy or expensive. Someone gave me a tip that Menards was selling a decent one for $250 so I went in to check it out (this was their East Towne location). After giving it a day of thought I decided to pull the trigger. I called the east side and they said they only had the floor model left (they were priced to sell). I asked if their other two locations had some in stock, and they said the west side did, so I called the west side and had one put on hold so I could buy it that evening.\\n\\nGet to the west side and they have the loveseat, not the couch. ARGGG, I thought these things were organized by SKU, you messed up on the store computer on that one, East Side. The Monona location still has one left though! It's the floor model, but now it's $200 (after $50 rebate). OK, fine. I go to the Monona location and ask if I can buy it now and pick it up in a few days when I can borrow my dad's trailer and haul it to my apartment. They say \\\"No\\\" we don't do prepay anymore. Darn. I ask if I can put it on hold and my dad can alter his schedule so that he can pick it up tomorrow morning (this was a deal on a couch that I didn't want to let get away). The sales associate calls his manager and they make a big exception for me. That I'm happy with, and I commend them for being flexible.\\n\\nHowever, I go to put it on hold, and they say that I need to pay for it now when I put it on hold. What??? So you first say that Menards doesn't do prepay (pay now, pick up later), but when I put something on hold to buy and pick up later, I have to pay now?

They also boast a computer at the customer svc.counter displaying the Menard's website, but it doesn't go \\\"on-line\\\".  They offer a price guarantee but have no way to verify or look up a competitor's price due to this seemingly and prevailing level of distrust of everyone.\\n\\nI will give Monona Menard's props in just ONE area (Monona Menard's has an extra large wood shed and selection) and that is their lumber quality and selection.

It tasted ok, but wasn't as flaky, tender, or flavorful as I'd prefer. Baked potato was foil-wrapped, and nicely cooked.  \\n\\nBattered cod had a decent batter that had just a hint of a unique flavor (we couldn't put our finger on it, as it was tasty), but it was fairly greasy and like the baked cod, the actual fish was quite \\\"lifeless.\\\"  The cheesy hash browns were good- nice and crispy, with only a hint of grease.\\n\\nBattered lake perch was just like the cod, only it was more greasy.

Jolly Bob's makes some tasty food. But to be honest, the \\\"jerked\\\" foods I've made at home were a lot better then the stuff I had eaten out.\\n\\nI figured I just didn't like Jamaican food all that much... I was wrong. Yeah I said it... I was wrong.\\n\\nDavid's Jamaican, in my mind, had quite a few strikes against it before I went. It was Jamaican food, which I wasn't thrilled about, it is a lunch buffet place, which rarely has great food, and I tend to overeat at those (Eye is greater than Stomach syndrome.)

They were still nicely crispy even in the buffet! Such a great flavor in the batter, but it didn't overwhelm the great catfish flavor either! With a bit of red beans and rice, which is a deceptively simple dish.\\n\\nThe waitress brought over a couple of spiciness levels of jamaican jerk sauces in squeeze bottles without us having to ask. This brought the whole meal to another level!\\n\\nTheir jerked pork was a freaking revolution in my mouth. This more then any other dish made me immediately realize I had wasted the last 6 months on burritos and sandwiches. Sweet and vinegary, with a strong jerk spice level. This pork has me coming back again and again. This pork is tender and so flavorful, but with a nice meaty texture which only come from long long stewing.\\n\\nFried chucks of chicken breast in a mango sweet/spicy sauce. Tangy, sweet, and made with high quality chicken. In this age of mechanically separated chicken, it's good to see somewhere which doesn't cater to the lowest common denominator.\\n\\nThe amazing food just goes on and on,\\n\\nAnd everything is tastier then the last.

This has become ours, in Madison. \\n\\nWe tried 3 or 4 others - including Rubys - and none of them could pass our litmus: it must be able to produce a decent General Tso's Chicken that isn't too sweet or gooey with a modicum of heat, the egg rolls must be fried in clean oil and we should never see canned vegetables. \\n\\nSo far, they have satisfied. The General Tso's is by far better than anything we have come across in Madison - and no, the chicken has not been spoiled for us. The battered coating before fry is not too heavy and the sauce has a little bit of heat. Personally I would like more chilis, but I realize that is an acquired taste. \\n\\nMu Shui style pork with plum sauce and pancakes has been fine, not dry and overcooked, and no sight of canned vegetables. Cold sesame noodles were the lightly dressed vinegar kind, not the peanut butter sauce kind. But they were fresh, not gloopy. Looking forward to trying other dishes on the menu but so far, it's been good. This has made us very happy, since we have always enjoyed Asian cuisines wherever we have lived (San Francisco, New York) and Madison seemed to have been devoid of decent Cantonese/Hunan/Szechuan style Chinese food. \\n\\nSure, it isn't Wu Leng Yi but it is quite adequate for those long work days when you get home and just don't want to cook.

Well, their pinball machines ares mostly pretty lame. The only machine worthy of your time or money is the Star Trek machine, which is pretty awesome. The others aren't so great. The Addams Family machine looks awesome, but man does it cheat!\\n\\nSo we did quickly glance at Yelp regarding their food, and we thought it was probably going to be mediocre...but we were hungry.  And it was indeed mediocre. My chicken sandwich was pretty basic California Chicken. It came smothered in some sort of spread. If you are going to use a cheap bun, you can't just smother both sides! My sandwich felt apart immediately. Ugh. The chicken was a little underdone as well, verging on pink. I didn't get sick from eating it, so that's a plus. I gave half of it to my roommate and he didn't get sick either. So the three of us all ate mediocre chicken sandwiches and we survived. People seem to like their pizza, so maybe go with that.\\n\\nThe crowd was also interesting. A bunch of bros and bottle blondes. That sums it up pretty accurately, actually. I felt some hard glares from across the bar from some sketchy looking dudes. With limited physical strength, I would absolutely not feel safe going to Pooley's alone on a Saturday night. Absolutely not. Maybe the daytime crowd doesn't look so threatening. \\n\\nThe bartenders were friendly, and did a great job.

When he came back he started to ask us a question and the very rude blonde check in girl interrupted him to say, you can't use those points to pay for a room, that has to be done ahead of time ONLINE. We had just driven 5 hours with 2 wild boys in the car to find out we couldn't stay there? That was what my brain was thinking. I was just really confused and surprised at to why she would get so abrupt and defensive and not even ask us any questions. Oh and she was still on the phone. The timid looking check in guy said the manager would be over to talk to us. He still had not said a word about whether or not we could use our points. I tried to ask him, and he seemed to have absolutely ZERO knowledge of how that worked. Maybe he was in training. My husband travels for work and stays at Best Westerns all of the time. He has never had a problem like this. The manager was extremely nice and we gave him our account/approval number from registering online. He was younger than both of the people at checkout and much more helpful and professional. He got us registered within 10 minutes. I just thought someone should know about this incident.

Prior good reviews left me favorably disposed toward this salon; however, my experience was disappointing at best.  I will be routing about 300 women elsewhere. \\n\\nThe owner/manager (pretty adult woman) started the nailbed preparation, and selected/glued on the tips to start my manicure.  NO complaints here- she seemed personable, competent, and really seemed to take care to ensure that the correct curve/flatness of each nail bed was matched according to the actual nail- I was really happy.\\n\\nHowever, it seemed that a regular customer (likely for a more expensive service) came in, so the owner/manager had a girl come over to take over the rest of my service.   \\n\\nThe girl did not seem to be happy to do so, as she was on the phone (one of two phones she juggled during the ENTIRE service), trying to straighten out some issue with a purchase of jeans on line.  She was barely on autopilot as she commenced with my nail application. \\n\\nShe literally DID NOT EVEN LOOK at my nails as she buffed/grinded away at the nail beds- am convinced as to that's why the final angles are so weird on them (hard for me to see at the time, as I'd not had nails for a long time, and could not really give them a good look during the process)..  \\n\\nWhen she did speak to me- it was to order me around several times (get nail polish color, pay, go wash up, go dry) and was very abrupt with every command, even though I'm at least twice her age, a paying customer, not a subordinate.\\n\\nIt was NOT a case of second-language/cultural translation -this girl was acting like a petulant b-word, full stop - to a person who was sincerely being nice to her, and who just didn't remember all of the ropes (nor should I have had to do so!).\\n \\nShe literally left the salon for an extended period (upwards of 20 minutes)during the time that my nails were curing under the uV.  A nice man clicked the light on again for another cycle after the first curing, but the curing went on for FOUR light cycles before she deigned to return to the job. \\n\\nWhen she did, she ordered me to wash my hands.  I did go to the back of the shop, saw clean and soiled receptacles for nail scrub brushes, and figured out that I should likely used the clean brush, scrub up, and then place the used brush in the oher receptacle - all assumed because she didn't deign to actually tell me ANYTHING (was AGAIN heading out a doorway with her phone).\\n.  \\nThere was a hot towel available for use- she had slapped it down on the counter on her way out, and God knows what was on the counter (though the place did seem to be clean, and I did notice the man take special care to sterilize/clean a pedicure station after a client while I was there).\\n\\nI did end up using it, but had no place to put the used towel.  She actually acted annoyed with me as she brought forth a hamper for me to place the towel.  \\n\\nAfter the application of the polish/topcoat, etc.- she pointed vaguely to an area in the back of the salon & told me to go there.  I then discerned that I was to put my hands under a light table to dry/cure the nails- but AGAIN- the communication was abrupt, rude, and uninformative.  \\n\\nI guess I didn't spend enough time under the light table (had no real idea how long to stay there), so I headed out, loaded up an elderly family member in the car, and noticed a mar on my middle fingernail.  No big deal- this happens- they'll fix it (based on prior experience).\\n\\nOn my return, she literally YELLED at me, in front of employees and other customers, for messing up my nail- told me that I should have stayed under the table for 15 minutes & to be careful for an hour thereafter.  RIGHT- I'm not going to fasten a seatbelt, insert a car key, etc. after I leave the salon.  Beyond that- YELLING AT CIVIL CUSTOMERS IS WRONG.. Again, petulant, abrupt, unreasonable -after I'd tipped 60+ cents/nail (for an ultimately lousy set of nails).\\n\\nAll delays caused my nail appointment to reach the near two-hour mark for a simple set of gel nails (and I was so steamed thereafter that I missed an important appointment due to the distraction.).\\n\\nAm certain this place is great if they deign to consider you to be a regular- there was a disabled man who came in for a manicure, and the man who attended him did so with a tender respect which I found heartening. \\n\\nHowever, that does not erase the facts of my own experience.

{"id": "ad2ddc9ad61740a27ce9bfdbf1553e81", "question": "This is a difficult review to write.  For years, Corkscrew was my favorite haunt and I could be found there for wine tastings each Friday and Saturday, occasionally for Sunday beer tastings, and sometimes just to stop by on off nights and sample some wines.  It was like a home away from home.  There was an ever-increasing group of regulars that lingered after the formal tastings to open bottles of wine and share with one another and with newcomers.  I met so many nice people there.  People shared wine and conversation and food.  It was a feeling of camaraderie, of family, and it extended even to the staff.  Wine tastings were held in the back corner of the store and people milled about in that close little area, lending itself to conversations and introductions and socializing in general.  That was in the days before \\\"Buvons\\\" and all the other frills.  Things have changed.  I returned to Corkscrew recently after a six month absence.  I paid $20 for a platter of three pieces of cheese, a few slices of bread, and a few apricots that cost me a mere $8 last Fall.  I was also surprised to see a charge of $2 for a glass from which to drink my wine purchase: another new fee.  Glasses were always free.  Many of the staff from my \\\"era\\\" left and management has changed.  The new manager, Todd Fusco, is a knowledgeable and personable guy who previously managed another favorite place of mine, Farren's.   He has inherited the current concept there.  He will do well because he has the savvy and personality to succeed.  Corkscrew still has their impressive selection of fine wine, craft beer, and other spirits.  It still has its weekly tastings and many new events, but people take their glass of wine and wander about the larger expanses of \\\"Buvons\\\" without the interaction of the old days.  I would hope that its staff would be as knowledgeable as those who have left.  Live music has been added, not something I particularly enjoy in some settings, like when I'm trying to enjoy a nice glass of wine and good conversation.  I am not necessarily resistant to change and I did make an effort when some of these changes were initiated last summer, but in my opinion the intimacy, the camaraderie has lost something in the redesign and restructure of the place.  The new Corkscrew appears successful which is nice because the people behind Corkscrew are nice people and were always good to me in the past. It's great to hear that so many people attend events there.  For me, however, it's  just not the same.  I shall always miss the old days, the little perks, the gathering of people, and the sense of belonging.  I give a rating of three stars because it still is the best wine emporium in C-U but withhold two stars for the loss of something unique and personal that it once offered.  If you were a part of that, you would understand.\\n\\nOn second thought . . Meh, I've experienced better.  Sadly, the \\\"better\\\" I experienced was the old Corkscrew, before this \\\"Buvons\\\" nonsense started.  I've given the new concept several tries and always come away disappointed.  It has become a cold, impersonal business.  Corkscrew has lost its soul, its heart, its spirit.  I mourn its passing.\\n\\nUPDATE:  Recently went to a \\\"wine tasting.\\\"  What a joke. Those participating were denied entry into the hallowed halls of \\\"Buvons\\\" and consigned to a small area near the cash registers.  I was then told that they were phasing out their weekly tastings, once the hallmark of the place and a draw for those new to wine as well as connoisseurs.  Prominently placed on the entry to said \\\"Buvons\\\" was a large, hand-drawn sign asking for a $6 cover fee.  Our group was granted a table in those hallowed halls and some bought bottles of wine to share.  I was one.  They were charging a $5 corkage fee for each bottle.  WHAT?!?!?  A corkage fee by definition is charged by a restaurant to patrons bringing their own wines.  We were buying our wines there.  When did this nonsense start?  In discussing the policy with some former regulars, I was regaled with stories of apathy by staff when asked if Corkscrew could get certain wines (which Binney's did get) as well as other costly and ludicrous changes in policy.  A pleasant wine experience has taken a back seat to live music.  In the poor acoustics of \\\"Buvons\\\" the music is loud enough yet musicians still use amps.  Conversations are impossible once the music starts, as is any enjoyment of wine and the overpriced cheese plates.  One would think staff would wear masks as they rob you blind but they feel no such need to hide their identity.  This demise of a once customer friendly, intimate wine emporium was difficult to see.  I recall my concerns when the owners planned to expand.  I said I hoped it wouldn't alter the conviviality of the place and was assured things would be the same.  Not a chance.  I read the reviews here and am astonished.  Then again, it sounds like the reviewers never knew what Corkscrew was like before greed took over.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment of the review is negative because the reviewer expresses disappointment, sadness, and a sense of loss for the changes that have occurred at Corkscrew.

The reviewer also laments the elimination of beloved traditions like the weekly wine tastings and the negative impact of live music on the atmosphere.

We absolutely loved it! Enough so that we went again last night. \\n\\nTheir twice-baked potato was fantastic, one of the best potatoes I've ever eaten. The only bad thing it that they only serve it on Friday and Saturday nights, so if you go any other time, you're SOL. \\n\\nOn our first visit, my son, my step-daughter-to-be and I all got beef and noodles. The children's version is served with mashed potatoes on the side, while the full-size meal is served over a bed of mashed potatoes. It was delicious and also very filling. Even though it was the nightly all-you-can-eat meal, I was only able to eat one plate. My fiance ordered fried chicken and it was very good. Lightly breaded and juicy, just the way fried chicken should be. \\n\\nOn our second visit I got the all-you-can-eat popcorn shrimp, the Saturday night special. Paired with the twice-baked potato, my meal was excellent. This was no tiny, marble sized shrimp; they were plump and perfectly fried. Not to mention, all-you-can-eat shrimp for only $8.75? Are you kidding me? My fiance got the beef and noodles, which was just as tasty as the first time. The kids got chicken strips and fries, which were just what you would expect, but the portions were huge. \\n\\nThe staff is very friendly and they remembered us from the first time we were there. Our waitress even commented that my son had gotten a haircut in between. The salad bar is nothing super special, but it's adequate. I loved the cucumber salad and the kidney bean salad. \\n\\nAlmost everything made here is done so from scratch. I don't know if the popcorn shrimp was, but the beef and noodles, fried chicken and mashed potatoes definitely were. According to the menu we brought home, they peel about one ton of potatoes a week. The homemade rolls are heavy and very good. Even better, they have apple butter in a squeeze bottle right at the table. I could almost make an entire meal of their rolls with apple butter. \\n\\nThe only bad thing about The Apple Dumplin' is their location.

Hopefully I'm just a singularity, but my experience was not as I hoped.  Twice I showed up to the shop to find no one in the office to help me.  Both times required tracking down a shop tech to get service.  Although I do agree that the people at this business are polite, I'm not sold on their competence or ethics.  While my vehicle was in for service, there was a part damaged in the process which I was not notified of at the time, and I subsequently found out several weeks later when my vehicle failed to perform a previously working function.  I returned to the shop and was received with good attitude and willingness to make the job right.  Unfortunately, once the vehicle returned to the shop for closer inspection/repair, I got a call telling me that my issue was the result of other part failures and not related to the damaged part that I suspected was the root issue.  They offered to fix the part I noted was damaged, but insisted that this was not the issue but rather the other parts that failed. Hesitant to let them do any further work, I picked up the vehicle and performed my own diagnostics only to find that the other parts that were \\\"found to be bad\\\" we indeed okay.  My vehicle was also returned with a dead battery (requiring a jump start to leave the shop), a small dent in the fender next to greasy hand smudges, and greasy hand smudges on the door handles and steering wheel.  I can't say with 100% certainty the dent came from this shop, but given its location and the nature of the service performed, and the level of attention I give my vehicle, I have strong reason to believe so.  While they still offered to fix the damaged part, I do not have confidence in the ability of this shop to complete the work to my satisfaction.\\n\\nAn additional part of my reasoning to work with this shop initially was that their rate was substantially less than the dealership.  Unfortunately, I had expectations of similar service, but that was not so.

These factors cumulatively led to a lack of confidence in the shop's ability to provide satisfactory service, despite the initial favorable pricing compared to a dealership."}

{"id": "993d77f547c96cd308c1864fdf455b70", "question": "It's a place that is easy to both love and hate. On one hand they have some unique academic programs and great professors, but you'll probably have to slog through lots sub-par classes before you get the good classes. \\n\\nBusiness is one of the \\\"better\\\" colleges, but you wouldn't know if from the lower level classes. My least favorite class ever was an upper level econ (econ is technically in LAS even though business people spend plenty of time in the department) class that was taught by a TA who not only didn't speak very good English, but who also gave really harsh tests. The first test average was a 64% and there was no curve. Grading is harsh here! Lots of people repeat classes. I also have plenty of bad things to say about accounting and finance classes, but it depends on the class I guess. \\n\\nLAS is the catch-all college that gets shafted a lot. Many of my lectures were too big and in auditoriums were literally falling apart. Contrast that with the much-funded engineering college's glittering shiny collection of brand new giant buildings. Oh well. \\n\\nACES, my college, is a bit of a catch-all college as well, but some of the majors are quite small. I've had my smallest and favorite classes in ACES. For development and other niche economics specialties this is the place to be and undergrads get lots of attention. It also has top-notch programs in other aggy stuff ranging from food science to animal science. I adore most of my professors I have had in this college. The only downside is that ACES has tended to attract some less than bright students in the past and has some programs within it in need of reform, but I'm sure that is true in many UIUC colleges.  I recommend ACES, but only if you are truly interested in the curricula. \\n\\nI would note that I skipped all gen-eds and a lot of ugly giant lower level classes thanks to APs and placements tests. If you can do that, it is worth it, because the upper level classes are where you can really enjoy academics. The lower level classes seem to be purposefully soul-crushing, with harsh curves, unintelligible TAs, and professors who just read off powerpoints. 101 classes are where learning goes to die. I basically did well on them by memorizing lectures off flashcards, a sad way to \\\"learn\\\" if you ask me. Don't be afraid to switch classes if you get a bad feeling on the first day. I did that a lot and it was worth it for the English-speaking TAs. \\n\\nI am personally not a fan of the Greek system, which welds a little too much power here. The drunken anti-intellectual environment can be stifling if you don't find a niche. Allen Hall is the place to be for anti-Greeks/hippies/outsiders and it has the bonus of small lower level classes often taught by people who actually care. Avoid the isolated residence halls like PAR and FAR, go six-pack only if you are Greek-ish, and ISR is the place to be for engineers and other assorted people who want to live near the science and engineering buildings. Dorm food is a mixed bag...it's mostly just inexcusably bad, but most people don't seem to notice because they think fries and hot dogs= acceptable lunch. \\n\\nI like the Chambana area, even if it has some minor annoyances. Ill-kept frat houses and a bizarre lack of on-campus grocery stores mar it, but otherwise it was easy for me to find restaurants to eat at and assorted drunk-free places to hang out. However, I can think of about ten major cities where I'd rather live.\\n\\nThe weather here is horrible.

Although, I will admit that I haven't eaten at every place around town, there aren't too many great Chinese restaurants around here (this does not include buffets).  Their General Tso's chicken is amazing.  Giant quantities for prices a bit on the high side, but not too bad considering how much you get.  Anything bigger than a small and you're guaranteed to take it home in a doggie bag tray thingy (are the trays seriously called doggie bags, too?) unless you're sharing it with someone else.  I usually only order the General Tso's or Vegetable Lo Mein (my default Chinese food preferences), so I can't really say much about the rest of the menu, but I did order soup there once and they gave me it in a giant bowl, with a decent amount of noodles.

After my first order from this place I wouldn't dare order again. I got the Double Sauteed Pork with \\\"Fried Rice.\\\" For one, there were more vegetables than meat, which isn't always a bad thing if the vegetables are good enough to want to eat, but these vegetables were the run of the mill cabbage, bamboo shoot, water chestnut, and sliced carrot medley that they probably stick in every dish they make. Sprinkled between the overly large vegetable pieces were slim strips of pork that were barely seasoned and covered with again, the run of the mill brown gravy that they probably smother every beef or pork dish they make, the worst part of which was that it was bland and tasted vaguely of corn-starch thickened soy. And last but not least, the dish came with a choice of white or \\\"fried\\\" rice. I opted for the fried rice which looked and tasted almost identical to what I imagine their white rice would have tasted like except that it was tinged yellow.

The waitresses were yelling and the tables were still dirty from the customers who had left. We went up to the counter to order, but she told us to sit down with our menu. We saw a bunch of people walk in and order at the counter so we filled in our sheet and brought it up. At this point it was about 12:30 before she even took our sheet because the waitress were taking care of the customers who had just walked in. \\n\\nSo we sat there and waited, and waited and waited. 30 minutes had gone by and nothing. 40 minutes. Nothing. We were very upset because we only had a short lunch break. About 43 minutes later, our first dish came out. Slowly, our little dim sum dishes came out. One by One. Our dishes were being thrown on the table without care and the waitress just left without telling us what it was. We went up to get some hot tea as well and both containers were completely empty. We to complain and the manager said that this was a new girl and she didn't really have a handle on things yet. Our last dish came about 45 minutes later from our first dish. \\n\\nA few of the dim sum dishes were really tasty, but it did not make up for lack of management and service skill.

{"id": "3f897812198f76033714c63d1213f95e", "question": "Let me start by saying, I have not had a problem with the staff. I have seen Dr. Deem and really liked him. He is very down to earth, understanding, knowledgeable, and comforting. I would highly recommend him as a primary care provider. I have also seen a few nurse practioners here in other departments that I have liked. Unfortunately, my biggest problem is with billing. What I have learned by working in the health field is that most people do not understand billing and health insurance and therefore often times get overcharged. I have only been to Christie Clinic a few times, but I seem to have a billing issue every time I go.  My first appointment I had was a preventative annual physical which should be billed as such in order to have the appointment paid at 100%. There also should not be a co-pay for preventative physicals according to my insurance. However, instead of billing it as an annual physical, Christie Clinic seems to only bill as medical office visits. There is a big difference between the two especially when it comes to payment. I have tried to call to resolve this problem, and all they told me is  \\\"you probably said something during the visit that made it an office visit instead of a physical.\\\" Something I said? Really? Even the labs that the doctor ordered for me were labeled as \\\"preventative screening.\\\" Even when the doctor entered the room, he said \\\"You're here for an annual physical right?\\\" Yet, apparently I \\\"must have\\\" said the wrong thing during that visit. \\n\\nThe other separate issue I had is I went in for an annual pap smear last year. Which was also supposed to be paid 100% because it is preventative screening. Well first of all, the doctor billed the reading of the specimen on a separate day from the actual visit. Therefore, (according to my insurance) it looked as if I made two visits in the same week and therefore my insurance only paid for the first date that they used for billing. If they were billed on the same day like they should have been, I would not have had a bill. \\n\\nOn another visit, I had some lab work that came back abnormal. I did not get a phone call, a letter, or any type of response from the clinic, letting me know of my abnormal results. I did not call them myself because they told me that I would not hear back from them unless there was a problem. Therefore, I thought everything was fine. Not only did I not know of a problem in the first place, but they decided to do further testing without even notifying me first. They did further testing on the specimen without my consent. The only way I found out about this further testing and initial abnormal result is from the bill I received 9 months later. Yes, 9 months later. When trying to discuss the bill, they told me that the bill was final and there was nothing that they could do.\\n\\nNot to mention, if you ever ask for paperwork with the diagnosis codes on them, a good majority of the time Christie Clinic uses diagnosis codes for what they are trying to rule out. For example, when trying to rule out multiple sclerosis, they actually DIAGNOSE you with multiple sclerosis even when it has not been confirmed by testing. That's a pretty serious diagnosis if you ask me. I have seen it done with other things too such as myasthenia gravis, pneumonia, seizures, etc. Good thing insurances are not allowed to deny you coverage based on pre-existing conditions anymore...", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment of this review is negative because the user details multiple issues with billing practices and communication failures at the clinic.

I was hungry so I enjoyed my chips still and ate the whole basket. When my carne asada came it was not what I expected. The meat was hidden in a pile of chopped up onion, peppers, and large chunks of green onion stems. Why would you put giant pieces of green onion in with the carne asada. These were not pleasant and bitter tasting. The carne asada is usually very tender the way it was prepared. This was again not the case. Very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy. The problem is that it was thinly sliced so it was quite over cooked. The refried beans was a soupy mess, but the mexican rice was passable. All and all this does not come even close to maize in the term of quality and flavor. Did I mention that there was so much oil in the dish... Finally when I paid I did not get an itemized receipt but as I saw him adding the price of the entree I believe I was overcharged as the menu list 8.99 for the carne asada, but I was charged 9.50.

This location is right in the middle of campus and is super busy during lunch hours. We arrived before the rush and easily found a table, but if you come late, good luck. There is no large menu on the wall, but rather a menu at the table where you order which is sort of annoying as you can hold up the line if you are waiting to order or the menu along the wall. There are daily specials which is posted on the sign outside. Today Tuesday was dollar off classic gyro or 1/2 price fries. Other than that the combos are about 7-8 dollars a pop. This is where it falls short. The fries that come with the combo is a very small portion. I can't imagine that it is just a small helping of fries on a little serving basket. Usually that is a highlight when you go to gyro restaurants because it adds to the grease appeal. Additionally, they are quite stingy with the meat, i.e. they actually weigh and measure how much gyro meat you are getting. I have never been to one where you can get 4 different sizes of gyro meat. Overall a little disappointing. I can't say the large was very filling for me.. but who knows. One plus is that they have a dispenser for yogurt sauce so you can douse your gyro to your heart desire. \\n\\nPro: fast service, self service no need to tip\\n\\nCons: limited seating, very small fries portion, personally the gyro sizes that are measured seems a little stingy come on...\\n\\nHidden gem:\\n1.

None of them, even for the ones provide no service at all, had left me with such a horrific memory.

I stood at the door for the better part of 10 minutes before I grabbed my own menu and finally seated myself. I saw the waitress running around the restaurant, frantically trying to accommodate everybody. She finally made her way over to me and took my drink order. Since I had ample time to look over the menu, I already knew what I wanted and had placed my food order at that time as well.\\n\\nI ordered the fried goat cheese as an appetizer and the Filet--cooked MEDIUM! My goat cheese came out about 5 minutes after ordering. Looked great...but she forgot my bread. When I got her attention and asked her for the bread that is suppose to be served with the goat cheese, she told me they didn't have any fresh bread ready, but there was some in the oven. Needless to say, 10 minutes had passed before my bread came out! Now my goat cheese was cooled and not easily spreadable! \\n\\nFrom that point, I waited for an additional 15 minutes before my meal came out. It looked great! The seasoned fries that came with the fillet were pretty good. As I sliced into my fillet, a pool of blood came gushing out!!! I cut the fillet in half, down the middle and spread it apart. It was so red and bloody, it almost looked purple! The center of the fillet was cool to the touch! \\n\\nI immediately got the attention of the frazzled server and brought it to her attention. She apologized and took the steak back to the kitchen to be put back on the grill. I sat and waited another 15 minutes before I saw my fillet again. It was the same piece of meat brought back out with fresh garnishments. I parted the fillet once again, only to find my steak was just as bloody and bright red as the first time! Now I'm livid! It was once again, cool to the touch! Keep in mind, I'm paying almost $30 for this dinner, without appetizer or drink. \\n\\nI brought the server back over and asked her if she thought my fillet was cooked medium...she hung her head in shame, apologized once again, and agreed with me that the fillet sitting in front of me was nowhere near medium. She pulled the plate back and was going to take it back to the kitchen when I stopped her and told her to box it up, and I will take it home and cook it myself! I gave Luna 2 different opportunities and around 90 minutes of my time, only to be disappointed again! I boxed up my fillet, paid my bill, and left the restaurant mad, once again! The only thing she did to compensate me for my experience was, a free drink. Meanwhile, I paid a $42 bill, for a horrible dinner, for myself! \\n\\nThe service sucks, their attitude is horrible and the food is so overpriced! If the owner would call me today and offer me a free meal, I would hang up on her! I'm never going back! I've wasted enough time and money in that place!

Saag paneer is phenomenal for those interested in vegetarian options.  Lunch buffet had probably the best naan I've tried in many years.

{"id": "9701af2325ed25e2f569a64de6deba9c", "question": "I worked here for a few months (August until two days ago).  I was fired on a very contrived reason - I think it was because this place doesn't get enough business.\\n\\nLocation is pretty bad for visibility, even if it's convenient to campus.  Food is very average, but I like it more than, say Panda Express.  My parents run a restaurant so I have experience (which is why I was hired in the first place) - this is one of the most inefficiently-run restaurants ever.  The vegetable dishes are good, though, and the Chinese-language menu is generally good quality if you don't mind a wait.  The bosses both cook when necessary, but it's best to come during weekdays, when the main cook is in.  The hot pot is also fairly popular, but most of the meats are frozen.  Other things that are frozen include the \\\"Wheaten Foods\\\" menu (potstickers, wontons, and meat buns).  I think that's pretty SOP here in CU, though.\\n\\nPortion sizes are okay.  They definitely shrank in the 3 months I worked there.  I won't analyze pricing, because I'm not used to eating out, but I think most people consider them fair or just slightly overpriced.\\n\\nThings to not get include the highly-Americanized items on the menu, especially those with breaded chicken in them.  The quick lunch was phased out mostly - now it's a selection of two Chinese braised dishes, so they keep pretty well (and have an average turnover).  Instead, they now offer \\\"Combos,\\\" which are your standard rice and a main dish, with an egg roll.  They used to give a soda with these, but now only offer iced tea, hot tea, or a small bowl of egg drop or hot and sour soup.  Don't get the soups (including noodle soups) or appetizers unless you really like egg rolls (they're decent but nothing special).  Certain dishes like the pork with mustard greens (P10, IIRC) are frozen, but I think they're probably okay if you don't mind them defrosting/reheating via microwave.  The smoothies and bubble tea are a no-no - they're edible and not too terrible, or so I hear, but go to Evo's or some other place for these; the slushies are okay if you don't mind a lot of sugar.  Most customers seem okay with the fish, but it doesn't look too great to me (aka it smells, and fresh fish doesn't).  To qualify that last statement, it doesn't reek like rotten fish, but you can definitely get a stronger smell than I think is usual when you gut one (I bass fish at home and clean my own catch) - plus, while it's inevitable, it's frozen and quick-defrosted (aka in the sink, in a water bath with direct contact, rather than through a bag).  Hardly sanitary).\\n\\nLike some other reviews have stated, they really do skimp as much as possible on ingredients, equipment, etc.  Ingredients come in on Thursday nights from Far East, and I'm not sure when other ingredients come in.  However, I'd say to come on Friday, because they probably push the old vegetables on Thursday (I only worked TR lunch and Sundays, so I can't say for certain).\\n\\nA few big points about the owners' behavior (which they also try to instill in the workers): first, they will try to dissuade you from getting something that they feel is too much trouble to cook at the moment, never mind if they have all the ingredients ready (usually this is because it's busy); secondly, they do cut corners, as aforementioned.  Another thing that most people probably aren't too concerned about because they aren't very aware of it, is the matter of the \\\"special soup.\\\"  They only give it to regular customers, but more generally to any Chinese or Chinese-speaking customers.  If you're not Chinese/speaking-proficiency or a repeat customer who asks, tough luck (I've seen this attitude referred to on foodie blogs as \\\"soup Nazism\\\").  A last point on their behavior is that they will lie about what they have and don't have, especially when it comes to drinks or if they feel they're too busy to bother with your order.  Normally this happens with drinks (they keep changing their Combo meals, and they decided to stop giving sodas with them because they didn't want to stock up); they will also refuse to make you a smoothie or other blended drink if they're busy.\\n\\nBasically, they have an undersized facility, an undertrained staff (one of the bosses in particular gets in the way more than he keeps things going), an undersized staff, and basically a very mediocre business model.  I'm kind of astounded they've survived, but if you know what to get, you can get a pretty decent meal here.\\n\\nTo conclude, there aren't a lot of repeat customers, but they try to treat the ones they recognize well.  However, I went to Cravings with a friend yesterday, and I saw a lot of former customers that stopped coming there.  I'd say they made a good choice (Cravings has much better service, food, and atmosphere).  Other good Chinese restaurants in the area, in no particular order, include Mandarin and Lai-Lai.

First issue was that we weren't given any napkins and had to ask once we were served food, which to be honest isn't a big issue, but it took over 30 minutes to get a couple of sushi rolls when the place wasn't busy.  Our waitress didn't really bother to stop and ask how we were doing during our meal.  When we were done eating, our waitress asked us if we wanted some green tea, to which we accepted.  However, she left and didn't come back for about 15 minutes or so, with no tea.  At this point we decided to just ask for the check and leave, which took about another 10 minutes, although she came back with tea this time.  \\n\\nIf you have the time, then Kamakura is a pretty good choice in terms of sushi, and I've had good experiences with their teppan in the past.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment in this review is negative because the customer had a lackluster experience primarily due to poor service at the restaurant. The slow service, unattentive waitress, and delays in fulfilling simple requests such as napkins and green tea all contributed to the negative experience. Despite the decent food quality, the overall dining experience was marred by the service issues, leading to a negative review."}

Ordering Bento box (me), one of those fancy soft shell crab sushi rolls (her). Minutes go by. Many. After almost an hour, talking to the waiter. \\\"We've got management problems\\\" he says, like in a bad sitcom in which *we* the customers are supposed to feel sorry for *him*. More time passes by. Finally my lunch box comes in. Close to inedible. The Sarku chicken (cheap fast-food!) in Market Place Mall is many many degrees of magnitude better. How about the sushi we ask? \\\"Your order had a lot of complications (!). First they've burned your chicken then they've forgotten to put the crab in the sushi roll.\\\" No kidding? Not, apparently.\\n\\nAfter ten minutes: sorry we have to go, we said, we'll get the sushi roll (a $15 one!) to go. The waiter kind of half-apologizes and says: \\\"I won't charge you for the sushi.\\\" Probably we were way too polite, or didn't show anger or something, because when he brought the check the sushi was there included, with no explanation regarding the change of mind. We actually had to leave, I had an appointment. Friend eats sushi a little later.... there is no crab in it (15$ roll!), just the traces of the skin of the soft shell crab. (Yes, we know the delicacy that soft shell crab, properly prepared, can be.) All in all an incredibly bad experience, almost on a par with the other horror stories restaurants in Chambana - B Won and The Great Impasta.   \\n\\nThe name and reputation of Japan, for which I have the greatest respect, don't deserve this cruel bastardization!", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment in the review is negative because the customer had a frustrating and disappointing experience at the restaurant. The long wait times, poor quality of food, errors in their order, lack of proper apology, and overall poor service all contributed to a sense of dissatisfaction and unhappiness. Additionally, the discrepancy in the billing for the sushi roll further compounded the negative experience. The customer even compares the experience to other negative restaurant stories in the area, emphasizing the extent of their disappointment."}

The service was good though and is the only reason that I have not given them 1 star. you really are better off buying sushi at schnuks. There are much better places in the nearby area.", "choices": ["Positive", "Negative"], "answer": "Negative", "rationale": "The sentiment is Negative because the review mentions that the sushi restaurant is overpriced and serves mediocre food, focusing more on atmosphere and presentation rather than quality. The reviewer also suggests that better sushi can be found elsewhere in the nearby area. While the service is noted as good, it is not enough to offset the disappointment in the food quality and value for money."}
